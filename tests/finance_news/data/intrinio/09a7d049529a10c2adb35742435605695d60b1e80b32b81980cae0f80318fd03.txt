To make these adjustments, we use the X-12 Procedure of SAS to remove the seasonal component of the series so that non-seasonal trends can be analyzed. This procedure is based on the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on this program can be found at http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/. The seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureauâ€™s X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed.
