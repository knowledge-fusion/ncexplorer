Briefly, Gradual Replacement Of Beehive With Byproduct Coke Caused Large Numbers Of Beehive Ovens To Quit Producing Coke. The Bureau Of Census Did Not Drop Such Ovens From Its Lists Until A Special Inquiry In 1929 Indicated That A Considerable Number Of Ovens' Status Should Be Changed From Idle To Abandoned. The Number Of Beehive Ovens Counted As Abandoned In 1929 (11,611) Was Unusually High (Compare To 8,299 Counted As Abandoned In 1928 And 6,503 In 1930).

While The Annual Figures Through 1939 Were Based On Daily Figures Multiplied By 365 (366 In Leap Years) The 1940 Figure (59,394,070 Tons) Was Obtained Through A Special Survey (See Minerals Yearbook 1940, P.870) And Is Probably Not Quite Comparable To Earlier Data.
