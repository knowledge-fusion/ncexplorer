Data Include Iron Ore And Ironstone Mines And Openworks. Data For May-November, 1898 Are Affected By Employment In Scotland. The Drop In March, 1912 Is The Result Of A General Coal Mining Stoppage. Beginning In 1920 It Is Assumed That Data Refer Only To Mines In Great Britain. A General Coal Mining Stoppage Occured In October, 1920. Employment Is Low In May-December, 1926 Primarily As The Result Of The Decreased Demand For Iron Ore At Iron Ore And Steel Works Due To A Shortage Of Fuel.
