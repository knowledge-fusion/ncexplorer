The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adjusts the data to offset the seasonal effects to show non-seasonal changes: for example, women's participation in the labor force; or a general decline in the number of employees, a possible indication of a downturn in the economy. To closely examine seasonal and non-seasonal changes, the BLS releases two monthly statistical measures: the seasonally adjusted All Employees: Total Nonfarm (PAYEMS) and All Employees: Total Nonfarm (PAYNSA), which is not seasonally adjusted.  The series comes from the 'Current Employment Statistics (Establishment Survey)'  The source code is: CEU0000000001","observation_start":"1939-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":56,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Thousands of Persons","units_short":"Thous. of Persons","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$PAYORK0LFN","index_name":"Civilian Labor Force in York County, PA","fred_symbol":"PAYORK0LFN","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-12-30T17:16:37.000+00:00","description":null,"observation_start":"1990-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Thousands of Persons","units_short":"Thous. of Persons","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$PAYORK0POP","index_name":"Resident Population in York County, PA","fred_symbol":"PAYORK0POP","update_frequency":"yearly","last_updated":"2015-08-05T21:17:44.000+00:00","description":"Data for \"Resident Population\" are from estimates as of July 1.
