This Industry Accounts For Approximately 12% Of Employment In \"Miscellaneous Primary Metal Industries\" In 1947 (Then Called \"Other Primary...\"), And If Added To That Group In 1953 Would Account For About 8%. The \"Lighting Fixtures\" Group Is Included Through 1951, And Has Been Excluded In The Second Segment Of This Series Beginning In 1951. None Of The Other Series Repesenting Nonferrous Metals Can Be Eliminated From The Group \"Fabricated Metal Products...\" Significantly Lower Figures For June-July 1952, And July 1956 Reflect Work Stoppage.
