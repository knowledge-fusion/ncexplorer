Separate Data For Each Group Are Available In The Sources For 1920 And Following Years. For The Years 1915-19, Data On This Category Are Not Separable From \"Commercial Buildings,\" As Defined In Series NBER 02187 & 02188 In General, This Category Covers All Private Nonfarm Nonresidential Buildings Not Included In \"Industrial\" Or \"Commercial,\" Except Buildings Constructed By Railroads, Local Transit Companies, And Public Utility Companies For Their Own Use. For A Detailed Listing Of Types Of Buildings Included, See \"Construction Reports, Construction Activity,\" C30-61 Supplement, U.S. Bureau Of The Census, October 1964, P. 73. Because Of A Change In The Classification Of One Type Of Warehouse From \"Miscellaneous Nonresidential\" To \"Commercial,\" The Data Beginning In 1956 For These Two Categories, And For\"Other Private Nonresidential Buildings\" Are Not Strictly Comparable To Those For The Period Before That Date.

The Annual Value-Put-In-Place Data Represent Annual Expenditure Estimates Prepared By The Bureau Of Public Roads. Monthly Data On Value Put In Place For Federal-Aid Highways (Interstate And State) Are Based On Bpr Monthly Estimates, Adjusted To The Level Of The Annual Expenditure Estimates For This Category Of Highways. Monthly Data For All Other Highways Are Based On The Annual Expenditure Estimates, Distributed Monthly By Applying Seasonal Indexes Computed From Final Data For Federally Aided State Highways. The Final Bpr Annual Estimates Do Not Become Available Until Two Years After The Period Reported. Data Published Before That Time Are Preliminary Figures Based On Projections Made By The Bpr. The Procedure For Estimating Value Of Highway Construction Put In Place Was Revised In 1963. In 1964 Data Were Revised Back To 1946. The Revised Data Are Considered Comparable With Data For Earlier Periods. The Constant Dollar Series Is Derived From A Quarterly Cost Index Of The Bureau Of Public Roads, Interpolated Monthly By The \"Engineering News-Record\" Index.
