The Usual Bureau 3-4 Method (Including A Week Ending On The 3Rd As Falling Within The Past Month) Has Not Been Followed In This Series. This New Precedent Is Taken From H.A. Wallace, \"Agricultural Prices,\" Where This Method Is Used. Where Figures Are Omitted In The Source, Whether Highs Or Lows, The Missing Figures Have Been Filled By The Average Of The Remaining Highs Or Lows, Respectively, Thus Giving Always Equal Weights To The Number Of High And Low Quotations. The Grades Quoted Change From Time To Time, But Except In 1900, They Appear To Be Comparable, This Sometimes Shown By Overlaps. The Change From 1899 To 1900 Was A Jump Of Several Grades, That Is, From 5-A To 2-A, Thus Making The 1900 Data On Too High A Level To Be Comparable With Previous Data. Therefore, From 1900 On, The United States Department Of Agriculture Figures Should Be Used. These Data Refer To Monthly Average Prices For Native Beef Steers, All Weights, 750-1800 Pounds, Compiled By The Chicago Daily Drovers Journal. Beginning With January, 1922, They Are Average Prices Of All Grades Compiled By United States Department Of Agriculture -- Native, Excluding Western.
