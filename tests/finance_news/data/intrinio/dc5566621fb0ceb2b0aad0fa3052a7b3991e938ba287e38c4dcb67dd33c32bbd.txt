The percent changes are at a simple annual rate and have been adjusted to remove (i) the effects of nonbank structure activity of $5 billion or more and (ii) the estimated effects of the initial consolidation of certain variable interest entities (FIN 46) and off-balance-sheet vehicles (FAS 166/167). Information about these adjustments is documented in the H.8 Notes in the Data section (http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/h8notes.htm) of the H.8 Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States release from the Board of Governors. To make the current and past levels comparable, a ratio procedure is used to adjust past levels. For example, if on December 31, 2008, real estate loans at large banks increased by 1 percent because a large bank acquired a nonbank during that week, the levels for real estate loans at large banks for all weeks prior to December 31, 2008, would be increased by 1 percent and then the percent changes would be calculated using those adjusted levels. These quarterly percent changes are calculated from quarterly levels, rounded to the nearest $100 million, based on the average of the three monthly levels in each quarter.
