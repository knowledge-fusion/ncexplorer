Value of 100 means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20 percent down payment. For example, a composite housing affordability index (COMPHAI) of 120.0 means a family earning the median family income has 120% of the income necessary to qualify for a conventional loan covering 80 percent of a median-priced existing single-family home. An increase in the COMPHAI then shows that this family is more able to afford the median priced home.  This index is calculated as composite of the fixed and adjustable rate mortgages.","observation_start":"1981-01-01","observation_end":"2015-10-01","popularity":62,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Index","units_short":"Index","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$COMPMS","index_name":"Manufacturing Sector: Compensation Per Hour","fred_symbol":"COMPMS","update_frequency":"quarterly","last_updated":"2015-12-02T15:26:14.000+00:00","description":"Effective February 5, 2004, Productivity and Cost measures for the manufacturing sector are now reported using the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
