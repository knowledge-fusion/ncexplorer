The index is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the underlying indicators whose contribution to the CFNAI is positive in a given month less the sum of the absolute values of the weights for those indicators whose contribution is negative or neutral, expressed as a proportion of the total sum of the absolute values of the weights. By construction, the sum of the absolute values of the CFNAI weights is one. To make this measure comparable to the CFNAI-MA3, the three-month moving average is calculated.

Such early detection is important because financial stress can quickly be amplified when stress is occurring in more than one market. The CFSI tracks stress in six types of markets: credit markets, equity markets, foreign exchange markets, funding markets (interbank markets), real estate markets, and securitization markets. The CFSI is a coincident indicator of systemic stress, where a high value of CFSI indicates high systemic financial stress. Units of CFSI are expressed as standardized differences from the mean (z-scores).   The CFSI data for weekends and holidays is extrapolated.  To interpret the stress continuum, CFSI is first divided it into four levels or grades. The grade thresholds are dynamic and move slowly over time. The four grades are:   Grade     Description               Range Grade 1   Low stress period           CFSI < -0.733 Grade 2   Normal stress period      -0.733 ≥ CFSI < 0.544 Grade 3   Moderate stress period     0.544 ≥ CFSI < 1.82 Grade 4   Significant stress period   CFSI ≥ 1.82","observation_start":"1991-09-25","observation_end":"2015-12-30","popularity":65,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Z-score","units_short":"Z-score","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$CGAD1619","index_name":"Unemployment Rate: College Graduates: Advanced Degree: Master's Degree and Higher, 16 to 19 years","fred_symbol":"CGAD1619","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-11-06T17:01:02.000+00:00","description":"The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a percent of the labor force.","observation_start":"2015-10-01","observation_end":"2015-10-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Percent","units_short":"%","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$CGAD1619M","index_name":"Unemployment Rate: College Graduates: Advanced Degree: Master's Degree and Higher, 16 to 19 years, Men","fred_symbol":"CGAD1619M","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-11-06T17:06:06.000+00:00","description":"The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a percent of the labor force.","observation_start":"2015-10-01","observation_end":"2015-10-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Percent","units_short":"%","index_type":"economic"}],"result_count":294707,"page_size":100,"current_page":264,"total_pages":2948,"api_call_credits":1}
