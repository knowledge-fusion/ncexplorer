The current month's women worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula (described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect changes in the sample composition (the taper).","observation_start":"2000-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Thousands of Persons","units_short":"Thous. of Persons","index_type":"economic"}],"result_count":294707,"page_size":100,"current_page":1301,"total_pages":2948,"api_call_credits":1}
