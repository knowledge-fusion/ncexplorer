Indexes For Most Of The Eighteen Series Which Are Classified As Construction Materials Have Been Published Monthly Since 1919, But The Composite Index Begins In 1947. The Index Is A Weighted Average Of Relatives. Beginning In 1953, The Weights Are Based On Value Added, 1957-59, Which Is Estimated By Extrapolating From 1957 Value Added By The Ratio Of Production In 1957-59 To Production In 1957. For 1947-52, The Weights Were Based On 1947 Value Added Data; However, The Weighted Index Was Linked In January 1953 To A Weighted Index (In The 1959 Resivion) And Subsequently Converted To The Present Reference Period Of 1957-59. The Component Monthly Series Are Adjusted To Benchmark Data From The Census Of Manufactures And To Independently Derived Annual Indexes. The Indexes Represent Average Production Per Working Day With Public Annual Holidays Counted As Working Days But Allowed For In The Seasonal Adjustment. Seasonal Adjustment Is By The Source. For A Detailed Description Of The Index, See\"Industrial Production, 1959 Revision\"(1959);\"Industrial Production, 1957-1959 Base\" (1962); And\"Industrial Production Measurement In The United States: Concepts, Uses, And Compilation Practices\" (February 1964) - All Publications Of Board Of Governors Of The Federal Reserve System.

Data On Six Market Categories, Which Cut Across Major Industry Groupings Were Introduced In The New Series. The Market Category \"Construction Materials, Supplies, And Intermediate Products\" Includes Lumber And Wood Products, Excluding Wooden Containers; Building Paper; Paints And Related Products; Paving And Roofing Materials; All Stone, Clay, And Glass Products, Excluding Glass Containers And Kitchen Articles; And Fabricated Metal Building Materials And Wire Products. Data Are Collected From A Sample Panel Of Manufacturing Companies. They Are Reported Separately For Units Within A Company Which Are Reasonably Homogeneous As To Type Of Activity. These Units May Be Subsidiaries, Divisions, Departments, Or Plants, Depending Upon The Structure And Activities Of The Particular Firm. Monthly Shipment Estimates Are Based On The Sample, And Data From The \"Annual Survey Of Manufactures\" Are Used As Annual Benchmarks. The Latter Are Establishment-Based Data, In Contrast To The Company-Based Data From \"Statistics Of Income\" Which Were Used As Benchmarks In The Former \"Industry Survey\". As An Interim Procedure, Pending Further Study Of The Proper Level For August 1962 Was Established By Relating The Ratio Of Unfilled Orders To Shipments (From The Sample) To The August 1962 Shipments Estimates For Each Detailed Category. The Estimates For New Orders Are Net Of Cancellations. They Are Derived By Adding The Change In Unfilled Orders Between The Current And Previous Month To The Shipments Estimate. Tabulation Of The Series On The New Benchmark Basis Was Begun With January 1960 Data. Approximately Comparable Monthly Data Were Developed For 1953-1959. Seasonal Adjustment Is By The Source.

Materials Included Are Iron And Steel Products; Lumber And Wood Products; Portland Cement, Millwork, Paint, Varnish, And Lacquer, Asphalt Products; Heating And Plumbing Equipment; Clay Construction Products; Gypsum Products; And Plumbing Fixtures. An Index For Each Of The Ten Groups Is Constructed From Data On Production, Sales, Or Shipments Of One Or More Specific Materials.Data Are Compiled Quarterly For Gypsum Products And Plumbing Fixtures, And Monthly For The Other Eight Groups.

This Index Measures Changes In The Physical Volume Of Production Of Clay, Glass, And Stone Manufactured Products. It Does Not Cover Stone And Earth Minerals. It Is Based On Production Or Shipments Data From The Bureau Of The Census, The Bureau Of Mines, And Trade Associations, Such As The American Glassware Association; And On Bls Man-Hours Data. The Index Is Available On The 1957-59 Base Only From 1947; For Earlier Years The Latest Data Are On A 1935-39 Base. This Series Is Therefore Shown Here In Two Segments With An Overlap Of One Year. Most Clay, Glass, And Stone Products (85 Per Cent Of The Output In 1957-59) Are Classified As Construction Materials And Are Included In The Index For That Market Group. In 1957-59 They Accounted For Over One- Quarter Of Total Production Of Construction Materials. Major Revisions Of The Clay, Glass, And Stone Index Were Made In 1940, 1943, 1953, 1959, And 1962. In Addition To Changes In The Base Period, The Revisions Affected The Composition Of The Index, Weighting, Adjustment To Benchmark Levels, Types Of Basic Data Used, And Method Of Seasonal Adjustment.
