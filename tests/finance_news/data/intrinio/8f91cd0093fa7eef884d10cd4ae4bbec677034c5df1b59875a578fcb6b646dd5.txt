To make these adjustments, we use the X-12 Procedure of SAS to remove the seasonal component of the series so that non-seasonal trends can be analyzed. This procedure is based on the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on this program can be found at http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/. The seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureau’s X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed. For specific information on the SAS X-12 procedure, please visit their website: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/60372/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_x12_sect001.htm.","observation_start":"1990-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"SA","units":"Thousands of Persons","units_short":"Thous. of Persons","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$EUGE641TRADN","index_name":"All Employees: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities in Eugene, OR (MSA)","fred_symbol":"EUGE641TRADN","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-12-18T18:57:00.000+00:00","description":null,"observation_start":"1990-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":0,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Thousands of Persons","units_short":"Thous. of Persons","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$EUGE641UR","index_name":"Unemployment Rate in Eugene-Springfield, OR (MSA)","fred_symbol":"EUGE641UR","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-12-30T17:07:18.000+00:00","description":null,"observation_start":"1990-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":7,"seasonal_adjustment":"Smoothed Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"SSA","units":"Percent","units_short":"%","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$EUGE641URN","index_name":"Unemployment Rate in Eugene-Springfield, OR (MSA)","fred_symbol":"EUGE641URN","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-12-30T17:10:33.000+00:00","description":null,"observation_start":"1990-01-01","observation_end":"2015-11-01","popularity":11,"seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","units":"Percent","units_short":"%","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$EULLNQ","index_name":"Commitment Status, Percent of Amount of Loans Made Under Commitment for More than 365 Days, Low Risk, All Commercial Banks","fred_symbol":"EULLNQ","update_frequency":"quarterly","last_updated":"2015-10-07T19:16:29.000+00:00","description":"For further information, please refer to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's E.2 release, online at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/e2/about.htm or in the footnotes of the E.2, Survey of Terms of Business Lending Release.
