The seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureau’s X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed.

The two series are: (1) The RBA's spot and forward transactions with dealers in the foreign  exchange market. (2) The RBA's spot and forward transactions with the Australian Government  and with 'other' counterparties. Some researchers have been using the first series as a proxy for foreign exchange market intervention, but this is not appropriate.  The RBA engages in spot or forward transactions with dealers in the market virtually every day. Most of these transactions are never intended to influence the exchange rate. Rather, they are intended to cover orders for foreign exchange from clients such as the Australian Government. When the RBA sells foreign exchange to a client, it has the choice of meeting this out of its holdings of foreign exchange (official reserves) or buying the equivalent amount of foreign exchange in the market. Most of the time it does the latter, though even then the timing of the sale and purchase may not coincide precisely as the RBA seeks to time its transactions in the market to achieve the most favourable exchange rate possible. The RBA can also engage in foreign exchange transactions with counterparties other than dealers as a means of covering client orders.    In isolation, therefore, RBA transactions with dealers should not be interpreted as a time series on intervention. A closer approximation of an \"intervention\" series would be provided by the net of the two series - i.e. the net of transactions with dealers and transactions with the Australian Government and other counterparties.
