However, Some Firms Still Follow That Practice. The Chief Difference Between The Rma'S Data And The Exports Compiled By The U.S. Bureau Of The Census Is That The Rma'S Data Cover Only Shipments Of New Pneumatic Casings, While The Official U.S. Exports Cover Used And Retreaded As Well. Lend-Lease Shipments Were Considered As Replacement Shipments From 1941-1945. Shipments For Orders By The Office Of Economic Warfare (Originally The Foreign Economic Administration) Were, However, Considered As Exports From \"Late 1943 To The End Of 1945\" (1949 Survey Of Current Business, Statistical Supplement, P.284). On Account Of Government Restrictions, Exporters Had To Return Equipment Intended For Export, And Also Dealers Had To Return Equipment To Manufacturers.
