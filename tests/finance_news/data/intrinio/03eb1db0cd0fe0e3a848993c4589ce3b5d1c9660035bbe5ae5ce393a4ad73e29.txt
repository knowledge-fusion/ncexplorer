Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term \"usual\" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of \"usual,\" interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

Wage and salary workers are workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the earnings series, it excludes all self-employed persons, both those with incorporated businesses and those with unincorporated businesses.   Usual weekly earnings represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week.
