Cautionary note on the use of the integrated macroeconomic accounts (IMA) - The estimates that are provided on this page are based on a unique set of accounting standards that are founded on the SNA. Accordingly, some of the estimates in in the IMA tables will differ from the official estimates that are published in the NIPAs and FFAs due to conceptual differences. There will also be some statistical differences between the estimates in these tables and those in the related accounts. For further information on the conceptual differences, see the paper at http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/Integratedmac.pdf.","observation_start":"1946-10-01","observation_end":"2015-07-01","popularity":7,"seasonal_adjustment":"Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate","seasonal_adjustment_short":"SAAR","units":"Millions of Dollars","units_short":"Mil. of $","index_type":"economic"},{"symbol":"$NBISBIS","index_name":"Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Iceland©","fred_symbol":"NBISBIS","update_frequency":"monthly","last_updated":"2015-12-16T14:01:28.000+00:00","description":"Nominal effective exchange rates are calculated as geometric weighted averages of bilateral exchange rates.
