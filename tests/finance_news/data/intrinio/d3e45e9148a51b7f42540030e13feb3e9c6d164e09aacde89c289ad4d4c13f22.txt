Construction Materials Include (1) Nonmanufactured Commodities, Such As Lumber (Destined For Direct Use In Construction), Cross Ties, Sand And Gravel, And Crushed Stone; And (2) Manufactured Products, Such As Lumber Products, Cement, Brick, Rails, Structural Ironwork, Etc. (For Complete List Of Manufactured Products, See Source, Pp. 133-135) These Covered Commodities Include Some Which Were Classified Directly As Construction Materials, And Another Group Of \"Mixed Commodities,\" Such As Lumber, Wrought Pipe, And Statuary And Art Goods, For Which The Proportion Allotable To Construction Materials Was Estimated. Value Estimates Exclude Costs After Production, Such As Transportation And Distribution Costs. For The Period 1869-1919, Output, Exports, And Imports Were Estimated As Follows. Estimates Of The Value Of Output Are Based Primarily On The\"Census Of Manufactures\", Decennially, 1869-1899, And Quinquennially, 1899- 1919. Intercensal Estimates Were Developed From State Statistical Reports For Seven States (See Source, Pp. 232-233), Figures From Governmental Agencies Such As The Bureau Of Mines, And The Department Of Agriculture, And From Trade Associations Such As The American Iron And Steel Institute (See Source, Pp. 241-242). Exports Were Compiled From Detailed Statistics In The December Issues Of The\"Monthly Summary Of Foreign Commerce\" For 1893-1919. For 1869, And 1889-1893, Calendar-Year Totals Were Derived From The\"Quarterly Report Of The Chief Of The Bureau Of Statistics\", U.S.Treasury Department. These Basic Export Statistics Were Modified As To Classification Of Commodities, And Were Adjusted To Price Levels Comparable With The Output Data (Manufacturers' Or Producers' Prices). Imports For Consumption, Including Duties, Were Obtained From Fiscal- Year Data In\"Foreign Commerce And Navigation\", And Were Adjusted To A Calendar- Year Basis. For The Period 1919-33, The Data Are Based On Kuznets' Estimates (\"Commodity Flow And Capital Formation\", I, New York, NBER, 1938), Adjusted To Improve Comparability With Earlier Years. Ratios Of Kuznets' Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Consumption To His Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Output Were Computed For 1919 And 1929 And Interpolated For Intervening Years. These Ratios Were Applied To Kuznets' Adjusted Output Values. After 1933 The Estimates Are Rough Extrapolations. Values In 1913 Prices Were Derived By Applying Price Indexes To The Current Price Series. For 1914-39, Bureau Of Labor Statistics Indexes For Lumber And Building Materials And For Steel Rails Were Combined, Using 1926 Weights. For 1890-1913, A Similar Composite, Using 1909 Weights, Was Combined With An Index Of Structural Steel Prices, Computed From\"Metal Statistics\", 1938. For Years Before 1890, Series On Eleven Commodities Were Combined, Using 1909 Bls Weights, And The Resulting Index Was Linked To The Series For Later Years. See Lipsey And Preston, Pp. 284-285.

See Introductory Notes On Bls-Dept. Of Commerce Data For More Information. For Details On The Deflating Index Used To Derive The Constant Dollar Estimates Of This Ser- Ies, See Lipsey & Preston, Pp. 266-67. In This Series, The 1915-46 Figures Are Shown In 1947-49 Dollars; And The 1946-62 Figures In 1957-59 Dollars. The Series Is Continuous In The Source Except For The Change In The Base.

The Data Represent Value Of Work On Vessels Of Five Gross Tons And Over. For The Period 1889-1919, Estimates Of Value Of Output Were Used As Estimates Of Value Destined For Domestic Consumption. (No Adjustment Was Made For Exports And Imports.) The Primary Source For The 1889-1919 Estimates Was The \"Census Of Statistical Reports From Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, And New Jersey Were Used To Estimate The Intercensal Years From 1889 To 1919. For The Period 1919-33 The Data Are Based On Kuznets' Estimates. (\"Commodity Flow And Capital Formation\", I, New York, NBER, 1938) Adjusted To Improve Comparability With Earlier Years. (Shaw'S Figures Include All Work Done; Kuznets' Total Included Work Done On Completed Vessels Only.) After 1933 The Estimates Are Rough Extrapolations. Values In 1913 Prices Were Derived By Applying Price Indexes To The Current Price Series. For 1915-1937 The Deflator Was An Interstate Commerce Commission Index For Floating Equipment, Published In A Mimeographed Release By The Icc, Engineering Section, Bureau Of Valuation, July 1, 1940. For 1889-1914 Two Indexes Of Cost To Railroads Of Floating Equipment Were Averaged. These Indexes Were Reported In \"Cost Of Floating Equipment\" (President'S Conference Committee, Eastern Group Pamphlet 290). The Average Was Linked To The Index For Later Years.
