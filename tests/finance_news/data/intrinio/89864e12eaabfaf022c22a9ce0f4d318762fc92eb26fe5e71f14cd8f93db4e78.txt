Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.  The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.  Less than 60 Emergency / Crisis  60 – 69 Distressed / Unstable  70 – 79 Weakening / At-Risk  80 – 89 Good / Stable  90 and Above Excellent / Secure  What Does the Index Measure? We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.  Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.  Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment  Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics  Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances.  Key Measures: Mortgage and Rental Delinquencies, Housing as Percent of Budget  Sample Data Source: National Delinquency Survey  Credit. Responsible use of credit creates more borrowing options and lower costs. This category assesses the strength of credit scores and how well families manage their credit.  Key Measures: Credit Scores, Trade Line Utilization, Credit Delinquencies, Per Capita Bankruptcies  Sample Data Source: National Credit Bureau  Household Budget. Spending less than you make is the daily choice that leads to long-term success. This category measures families’ spending patterns and saving for emergencies.  Key Measures: Disposable Income, Savings, Consumer Confidence  Sample Data Source: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis  Net Worth. Strong, positive net worth creates options and independence. This category measures how well consumers are strengthening their personal balance sheets.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.  The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.

We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.  Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.  Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment  Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics  Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.  The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.

We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.  Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.  Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment  Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics  Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.

Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.  The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.

We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.  Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.  Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment  Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics  Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances.

The percent changes are at a simple annual rate and have been adjusted to remove (i) the effects of nonbank structure activity of $5 billion or more and (ii) the estimated effects of the initial consolidation of certain variable interest entities (FIN 46) and off-balance-sheet vehicles (FAS 166/167). Information about these adjustments is documented in the H.8 Notes in the Data section (http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/h8notes.htm) of the H.8 Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States release from the Board of Governors. To make the current and past levels comparable, a ratio procedure is used to adjust past levels. For example, if on December 31, 2008, real estate loans at large banks increased by 1 percent because a large bank acquired a nonbank during that week, the levels for real estate loans at large banks for all weeks prior to December 31, 2008, would be increased by 1 percent and then the percent changes would be calculated using those adjusted levels. These quarterly percent changes are calculated from quarterly levels, rounded to the nearest $100 million, based on the average of the three monthly levels in each quarter.
