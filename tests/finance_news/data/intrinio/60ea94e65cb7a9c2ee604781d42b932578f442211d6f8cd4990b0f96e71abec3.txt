Median CPI was created as a different way to get a “Core CPI” measure, or a better measure of underlying inflation trends.

The median price change is the price change that’s right in the middle of the long list of all of the price changes.

According to research from the Cleveland Fed, the Median CPI provides a better signal of the inflation trend than either the all-items CPI or the CPI excluding food and energy.
