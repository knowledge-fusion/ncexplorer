Peoples\u2019 focus might start turning toward the big football game as the weekend approaches, but for now, attention seems firmly locked on one market indicator: The 10-year Treasury yield, above 2.7% for the first time since 2014. Rising yields, as investors know, reflect inflation fears and can raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing the economy. They also can raise fears of a potentially more hawkish Fed. We\u2019ve had cheap money for a long time, and investors realize someday money might get more expensive. Stock futures trading pointed toward possible 200-point losses for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) early Tuesday, which would wipe out much of the rally from late last week but still leave stocks not far from all-time highs. None of this changes the fact that the year is off to an amazing start, and a couple days of sell-off isn\u2019t necessarily unprecedented. Besides yields, another number that indicates potential market worries is VIX, the so-called \u201cfear index,\u201d which leaped to 14.3 by early Tuesday after rising more than 20% on Monday. Meanwhile, foreign stock markets joined the selling, while oil got hammered and gold remained near recent highs. At times like these, it\u2019s important not to panic, or to try to time the market. Keep things in perspective, and remember that despite the worries about rates, even at 2.7%, yields remain historically low, and signs of inflation remain muted. Right now, it looks like fear of possible inflation more than any actual inflation might be hitting the bond market, and that\u2019s caused trouble for sectors like real estate and utilities that are more sensitive to rates. The telecom and real estate sectors both fell more than 1% Monday. Still, nothing looked too good on Monday or early Tuesday after every sector fell yesterday and energy cratered 1.55% to finish as the worst performer thanks in part to a loss in the oil market. Small caps also took it on the chin. Even financials, which often rise when yields go up, fell nearly 0.5% on Monday. Profit taking after last week\u2019s rally to record highs might have played a role, and don\u2019t count out the possibility of similar action today. Concerns about Apple (AAPL) are another weight early Tuesday. It\u2019s pretty well reported by now that analysts have concerns about iPhone demand. AAPL reports on Thursday, and its conference call could be well attended. Any signs of flagging iPhone demand, if verified by the company, would likely hurt, but it\u2019s also important to pay attention to what executives say about future product rollout and how they see demand shaping up. Meanwhile, stocks in Asia got hurt Tuesday as shares of AAPL supplier companies fell. We continue to see more warning signs ahead of earnings, especially related to iPhone X. A problem could be that $1,000 price point. AAPL shares the spotlight with more than 120 other S&P 500 earnings reports in what\u2019s arguably the busiest week of the season. Things started off on a strong note Monday as Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Seagate Technology (STX) both topped analysts\u2019 estimates. For LMT, the Missiles and Fire Control business helped light up Q4 revenue growth, rising more than 30%. Pfizer (PFE) and McDonald\u2019s are the big ones this morning, while tomorrow brings one of the busiest earnings days of the quarter highlighted by Boeing (BA) in the morning followed by AT&T (T), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) after the close. MCD reported earnings per share that easily beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 estimates, but the stock fell in pre-market trading, perhaps because company-owned same-store sales weren\u2019t as good as some investors had hoped. PFE results looked very strong, and expectations for the rest of the drug industry remain high. A Fed meeting starts today, under the guidance of Chair Janet Yellen for the last time. It seems unlikely the rest of the team would send Yellen off into the sunset with a rate hike, as odds remain below 5% in this week\u2019s meeting, according to the futures market. Still, Wednesday\u2019s statement is probably going to be the last with Yellen\u2019s imprint before Jerome Powell takes over ahead of the March meeting. Odds of a hike by then are around 75%, up slightly from last week. The focus could turn away from earnings and the Fed momentarily tonight when President Trump delivers his State of the Union address to Congress. Investors might want to consider watching to see what sort of tone the president takes. Trump\u2019s remarks at Davos last week seemed helpful to the market, especially because of some market-friendly language on trade. Also stay tuned to hear if the president has anything to say about infrastructure. That\u2019s something many investors have been waiting to hear more about for a while now after Trump\u2019s campaign promises, and the materials and industrial sectors both tend to benefit from major infrastructure projects. FIGURE 1: VIX TAKES OFF. \u00a0The VIX (purple line) hit a five-month high Monday, rising more than 20%. Volatility has been more prevalent so far this year, and higher bond yields might be one reason. Sometimes volatility also climbs during the heart of earnings season. VIX is compared here to the S&P 500 (SPX) over the last year. Recently, VIX has not only been rallying on SPX breaks, but also hasn\u2019t been receding on rallies in the SPX. Last week, it even rallied on an SPX rally. That\u2019s unusual for the so-called \u201cfear index,\u201d which tends to move inversely to stock prices. Data source: CBOE, Standard & Poor\u2019s. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae\u00a0platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Diving into Subs: Last week we looked at the S&P 500 sectors leading Wall Street so far this year, but it can also help to plunge further into the depths to get a sense of which sub-sectors are leading and why. The leading sub-sectors through the end of last week come from all around the economy, and that\u2019s potentially a sign that growth is firing on multiple cylinders. Internet and direct marketing retail stocks were up more than 21%, followed by department stores, biotechnology, health care distributors, and forest products, according to research firm CFRA. It\u2019s a little twist to see department stores on this list. So much ink has been spilled over the last two years arguing that department stores are dead, but it seems that investors may not all agree. As we noted last week, biotech got a tailwind from hopes for more mergers and acquisitions in the industry due in part to the tax bill. Health care distributors are among the leading sub-sectors in a roaring health care market so far this year and may be getting a boost from the failure of Congress to overturn health care reform last year, some analysts say. Forest products? Well, when people have money in their pockets, one thing they sometimes go out and buy is new furniture. Getting Healthy: Everyone is talking about info tech earnings this week, and that\u2019s no surprise considering earnings from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) all hit the wire over the next few days. Another sector coming into focus is health care, where some of the big reporting names include Pfizer (PFE) today, Eli Lilly (LLY) tomorrow, and Merck (MRK) on Friday. AbbVie (ABBV) posted strong quarterly earnings last Friday that some analysts said might be a precursor for some other big pharma firms. When LLY reports before the open tomorrow, investors might be looking for any impact from the 2017 patent expirations for LLY\u2019s Strattera, which treats ADHD, its blood clot medicine Effient, and Axiron, a testosterone treatment. Yields Rise Despite Inflation No-Show: Monday\u2019s rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 2.71% \u2014 the highest in nearly four years\u00a0\u2014came despite another lackluster government inflation report. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index rose just 0.1% in December, below Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations for 0.2%. Core PCE prices rose 0.2%, in line with consensus. PCE prices are up just 1.7% year-over year, down from 1.8% in November and still comfortably below the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. If inflation seems tempered, at least judging from Monday\u2019s data, why are yields still on an upswing? Perhaps there\u2019s a wind blowing in from overseas, where German bund yields rose above 0.7% to their highest level since late 2015.

Internet and direct marketing retail stocks were up more than 21%, followed by department stores, biotechnology, health care distributors, and forest products, according to research firm CFRA. It\u2019s a little twist to see department stores on this list. So much ink has been spilled over the last two years arguing that department stores are dead, but it seems that investors may not all agree.</p><p>As we noted last week, biotech got a tailwind from hopes for more mergers and acquisitions in the industry due in part to the tax bill. Health care distributors are among the leading sub-sectors in a roaring health care market so far this year and may be getting a boost from the failure of Congress to overturn health care reform last year, some analysts say. Forest products? Well, when people have money in their pockets, one thing they sometimes go out and buy is new furniture.</p><p>Getting Healthy: Everyone is talking about info tech earnings this week, and that\u2019s no surprise considering earnings from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) all hit the wire over the next few days. Another sector coming into focus is health care, where <a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/2018/01/big-pharma-earnings-lly-mrk-pfe-26180\">some of the big reporting names</a> include Pfizer (PFE) today, Eli Lilly (LLY) tomorrow, and Merck (MRK) on Friday. AbbVie (ABBV) posted strong quarterly earnings last Friday that some analysts said might be a precursor for some other big pharma firms. When LLY reports before the open tomorrow, investors might be looking for any impact from the 2017 patent expirations for LLY\u2019s Strattera, which treats ADHD, its blood clot medicine Effient, and Axiron, a testosterone treatment.</p><p>Yields Rise Despite Inflation No-Show: Monday\u2019s rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 2.71% \u2014 the highest in nearly four years&nbsp;\u2014came despite another lackluster government inflation report. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index rose just 0.1% in December, below Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations for 0.2%. Core PCE prices rose 0.2%, in line with consensus. PCE prices are up just 1.7% year-over year, down from 1.8% in November and still comfortably below the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. If inflation seems tempered, at least judging from Monday\u2019s data, why are yields still on an upswing? Perhaps there\u2019s a wind blowing in from overseas, where German bund yields rose above 0.7% to their highest level since late 2015.</p><p>Good Trading,<br>JJ<br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TDAJJKinahan\">@TDAJJKinahan</a><br></p> \n  <div> \n   <div>  \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <p>FIGURE 2: THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR. </p> \n   <p>Source: Briefing.com</p> \n   <p></p> \n  </div> </span> \n</div>", "score": 11.479233, "discoverDate": "2018-07-02T16:26:04.567+0000", "highlight": " action today.

Find a payout with 200%, 300% or even 500% upside? Then we have a secure way to total returns up to 500%. (We\u2019ll discuss five generous payers in a minute, with price upside up to 500%.) Why does dividend growth matter so much more than earnings, sales or even cash flow growth? Well, we income investors buy a stock for one of three reasons: When these factors combine, they can create 100% price upside with a safe dividend payers. Share prices tend to rise in tandem with runaway dividends, as investors pay more for the now-higher yield. Got a dividend grower that\u2019s cheap? Even better. It means that management can put its payout hikes on steroids by repurchasing its own bargain shares. (Look, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d \u2013 it works!) Let\u2019s discuss five fast growing payouts on already-cheap stocks. If I were the chief financial officer (CFO) of one of these firms, I would be salivating at how fast I\u2019ll be able to double these share prices. All have triple-digit upside potential, and all their CFOs need to do is to continue growing their dividends and repurchase cheap shares when appropriate. Apple (AAPL) Dividend Yield: 1.4% 5-Year Dividend Growth: 68% Forward P/E: 13.8 Apple (AAPL) is actually the \u201cslowest\u201d dividend grower on this list, at a five-year compound annual rate of \u201cjust\u201d under 11%. Everyone knows Apple for its devices \u2013 the iPhone still drives a majority of Apple\u2019s revenues, though its iPads, Macs and Macbooks still represent significant chunks of the top line. But the evolving story in Apple is its Services division. Services \u2013 which includes things such as iTunes, the App Stores and Apple Pay \u2013 jumped 31% year-over-year to $9.2 billion in revenues for the most recent quarter, putting the company well on its way to doubling Services sales between 2017 and 2020. Yes, that\u2019s far less than the $38 billion generated by the iPhone, but it still was enough to represent 15% of Apple\u2019s revenues for the quarter. Just like most everything else Apple does, the Services division drives fat margins, which filters down into ample cash flow. Moreover, Apple is finally putting its $270 billion cash reserve to work thanks to a forced repatriation resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So while Apple is a dividend dynamo that\u2019s growing its payout like a weed, investors also will enjoy the benefit of share buybacks. AAPL said this year it will repurchase a whopping $100 billion worth of shares, in addition to the record $23.5 billion it bought back during the March quarter. AES Corporation Dividend Yield: 3.9% 5-Year Dividend Growth: 225% Forward P/E: 9.9 Utility stocks are no stranger to lists of dividend growers. However, they tend to fraternize with other slow-income-growth plays thanks to their longevity but inability to raise rates more than a couple percent every year. Which means AES Corporation (AES) isn\u2019t your typical utility stock. AES, which provides power in 15 countries, started as a consulting firm in 1981 and eventually expanded to electricity generation by building plants and acquiring companies such as Indianapolis Power & Light and Dayton Power & Light. AES\u2019 dividend has been marked by rapid expansion in its formative years. The quarterly payout began in 2012 at 4 cents per share; it stands at 13 cents today. Also noteworthy is a significantly lower forward P/E than the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades at 16.5 times earnings estimates. Southwest Airlines (LUV) Dividend Yield: 1.0% 5-Year Dividend Growth: 300% Forward P/E: 10.1 Southwest Airlines (LUV) is a breath of fresh air in an industry that at this point is identified by being hated by its clientele. The discount airline has long put an emphasis on pleasing both its workers and its customers, with the focus on the first contributing significantly to the latter. Southwest frequently sits near or at the top of J.D. Power satisfaction surveys, including winning the low-cost category for 2018 with the highest overall score among all airlines \u2013 even \u201ctraditional\u201d carrier winner Alaska Airlines (ALK). While reliable profitability growth can be a challenge for airlines thanks to factors such as oil-price swings, Southwest\u2019s EPS have climbed \u2013 well, soared \u2013 every year since 2012. In fact, profits have exploded so much over the past five years that despite quadrupling the payout in that time, LUV sits at a laughably thin 8% dividend payout ratio right now. Expect Southwest\u2019s dividend growth to go essentially unchecked for years on end. Southwest\u2019s (LUV) Dividend Is Cleared for Takeoff Brunswick Corporation (BC) Dividend Yield: 1.2% 5-Year Dividend Growth: 300% Forward P/E: 12.3 Brunswick Corporation (BC)isn\u2019t a household name, but it has brought more fun to Americans than just about any company not named Disney (DIS). Brunswick is the name behind watercraft brands such as Bayliner, Flipper and Meridian Yachts; fitness products under brands such as LifeFitness and Indoor Cycling; and billiards under its namesake Brunswick brand. It also boasts a marine engine business. This company has seen quite a bit of tumult over the past few years. The company exited its bowling-center and bowling-supply businesses between 2014 and 2015, and announced in late 2017 that it would sell off its Sea Ray brand of pleasure boats. That has resulted in numerous restructuring and other charges that have injected some turbulence into the company\u2019s profitability. Brunswick (BC): Favorable Waters, Except on the Bottom Line That said, BC shares keep heading higher for a reason, and optimism about the company\u2019s future should keep that momentum intact. For one, Brunswick has opted to retain the Sea Ray business, and drastically change it. The company said in June that it will discontinue its yacht models and emphasize sport boats and cruisers instead. Analysts, meanwhile, are high on Brunswick\u2019s bottom line going forward, projecting 19% growth in adjusted profits, from $3.89 per share in 2017 to $4.64 per share this year, then 11.2% expansion to $5.16 in 2019. I\u2019ll stress that analyst estimates are based on \u201cadjusted\u201d earnings because Brunswick\u2019s profits over the past few years have involved a lot of one-time accounting shenanigans. For instance, last year\u2019s $3.89 in non-GAAP earnings actually into just $1.64 in GAAP earnings. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 even factoring all that in, Brunswick\u2019s current 19-cent dividend translates into a mere 46% payout ratio on its honest-to-god profits. I don\u2019t expect Brunswick to match its dividend quadrupler of the past five years, but I do expect it to easily outpace the market average. Zions Bancorporation (ZION) Dividend Yield: 1.3% 5-Year Dividend Growth: 500% Forward P/E: 13.2 Zions Bancorporation (ZION) is one of a handful of U.S. \u201csuper-regional\u201d banks that include the likes of Regions Financial (RF), KeyBank (KEY) and SunTrust (STI). At $10.8 billion in market cap, it isn\u2019t a mom-and-pop credit union, but it doesn\u2019t nave the national footprint of a Bank of America (BAC), either. Zions operates in 11 western states, under various brand names, in businesses ranging from small-business lending to mortgages to checking accounts to agricultural finance. Given that Zions is only doling out about 1.3% a year in annual yield, you could be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re better off squeezing income from a Zions Bank CD rather than its stock. I suggest a second look. Zions (ZION): A Reminder That Current Yield Isn\u2019t the Whole Story Zions was forced to drop its dividend from as high as 32 cents per share in 2018 down to just a penny per share until 2013. Right before its first increase in years (to 4 cents per share), the stock was yielding roughly 0.15% on shares trading around $27. Five years later, those same shares yield 3.6% on the original cost basis \u2013 not to mention they\u2019ve gained about 90% in value! That comes amid a burgeoning business that is enjoying a twofold boost from this burgeoning economy and the Federal Reserve\u2019s slow but steady rate-hiking, which helps Zions and other banks generate more net interest income. To wit, Zions primarily credited its 35% annual earnings growth in 2017 to a $198 million improvement in NII. Wall Street is looking for average annual profit growth of 10% a year for the next half-decade. That, as well as a meager 35% payout ratio, should have shareholders giddy about more breakneck dividend growth going forward. A 3-Step Process for 100%+ Dividend Growth Returns The very best dividend stocks rarely show high yields because their prices keep rising in line with the increasing payments. Most people never realize this. But those of us who DO stand to profit handsomely and almost automatically! It\u2019s a simple three-step process: Step 1. You invest a set amount of money into one of these \u201chidden yield\u201d stocks and immediately start getting regular returns on the order of 3%, 4%, or maybe more. That alone is better than you can get from just about any other conservative investment right now. Step 2. Over time, your dividend payments go up so you\u2019re eventually earning 8%, 9%, or 10% a year on your original investment. That should not only keep pace with inflation or rising interest rates, it should stay ahead of them. Step 3. As your income is rising, other investors are also bidding up the price of your shares to keep pace with the increasing yields. This combination of rising dividends and capital appreciation is what gives you the potential to earn 12% or more on average with almost no effort or active investing at all. I\u2019ve scoured thousands of stocks out there right now, looking for the very best companies that have both rising dividends and strong buyback programs in place \u2026 the kind of stocks that could easily spin off annual total returns of 12%, 17%, even 25% or more \u2026doubling your money in very short order. Right now, at this very moment, there are 7 in particular that I think you should consider buying. They stand to do well no matter what the broad market does \u2026 regardless of what happens in Washington \u2026 and irrespective of interest rate trends.

Find a payout with 200%, 300% or even 500% upside?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Then we have a secure way to total returns up to 500%.</p> \n<p>(We\u2019ll discuss five generous payers in a minute, with price upside up to 500%.)</p> \n<p>Why does dividend growth matter so much more than earnings, sales or even cash flow growth? Well, we income investors buy a stock for one of three reasons:</p> \n<p>When these factors combine, they can create 100% price upside with a safe dividend payers. Share prices tend to rise in tandem with runaway dividends, as investors pay more for the now-higher yield.</p> \n<p>Got a dividend grower that\u2019s cheap? Even better. It means that management can put its payout hikes on steroids by repurchasing its own bargain shares. (Look, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d \u2013 it works!)</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s discuss five fast growing payouts on already-cheap stocks. If I were the chief financial officer (CFO) of one of these firms, I would be salivating at how fast I\u2019ll be able to double these share prices. All have triple-digit upside potential, and all their CFOs need to do is to continue growing their dividends and repurchase cheap shares when appropriate.</p> \n<p>Apple (AAPL)<br> Dividend Yield: 1.4%<br> 5-Year Dividend Growth: 68%<br> Forward P/E: 13.8</p> \n<p>Apple (AAPL) is actually the \u201cslowest\u201d dividend grower on this list, at a five-year compound annual rate of \u201cjust\u201d under 11%.</p> \n<p>Everyone knows Apple for its devices \u2013 the iPhone still drives a majority of Apple\u2019s revenues, though its iPads, Macs and Macbooks still represent significant chunks of the top line. But the evolving story in Apple is its Services division. Services \u2013 which includes things such as iTunes, the App Stores and Apple Pay \u2013 jumped 31% year-over-year to $9.2 billion in revenues for the most recent quarter, putting the company well on its way to doubling Services sales between 2017 and 2020. Yes, that\u2019s far less than the $38 billion generated by the iPhone, but it still was enough to represent 15% of Apple\u2019s revenues for the quarter.</p> \n<p>Just like most everything else Apple does, the Services division drives fat margins, which filters down into ample cash flow. Moreover, Apple is finally putting its $270 billion cash reserve to work thanks to a forced repatriation resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So while Apple is a <a href=\"https://contrarianoutlook.com/9-rising-rate-buys-for-big-gains-and-cash-payouts-up-to-9-6/\">dividend dynamo that\u2019s growing its payout like a weed</a>, investors also will enjoy the benefit of share buybacks. AAPL said this year it will repurchase a whopping $100 billion worth of shares, in addition to the record $23.5 billion it bought back during the March quarter.</p> \n<p>AES Corporation<br> Dividend Yield: 3.9%<br> 5-Year Dividend Growth: 225%<br> Forward P/E: 9.9</p> \n<p>Utility stocks are no stranger to lists of dividend growers. However, they tend to fraternize with other slow-income-growth plays thanks to their longevity but inability to raise rates more than a couple percent every year.</p> \n<p>Which means AES Corporation (AES) isn\u2019t your typical utility stock.</p> \n<p>AES, which provides power in 15 countries, started as a consulting firm in 1981 and eventually expanded to electricity generation by building plants and acquiring companies such as Indianapolis Power &amp; Light and Dayton Power &amp; Light.</p> \n<p>AES\u2019 dividend has been marked by rapid expansion in its formative years. The quarterly payout began in 2012 at 4 cents per share; it stands at 13 cents today. Also noteworthy is a significantly lower forward P/E than the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades at 16.5 times earnings estimates.</p> \n<p>Southwest Airlines (LUV)<br> Dividend Yield: 1.0%<br> 5-Year Dividend Growth: 300%<br> Forward P/E: 10.1</p> \n<p>Southwest Airlines (LUV) is a breath of fresh air in an industry that at this point is identified by being hated by its clientele. The discount airline has long put an emphasis on pleasing both its workers and its customers, with the focus on the first contributing significantly to the latter. Southwest frequently sits near or at the top of J.D. Power satisfaction surveys, including winning the low-cost category for 2018 with the highest overall score among all airlines \u2013 even \u201ctraditional\u201d carrier winner Alaska Airlines (ALK).</p> \n<p>While reliable profitability growth can be a challenge for airlines thanks to factors such as oil-price swings, Southwest\u2019s EPS have climbed \u2013 well, soared \u2013 every year since 2012. In fact, profits have exploded so much over the past five years that despite quadrupling the payout in that time, LUV sits at a laughably thin 8% dividend payout ratio right now.</p> \n<p>Expect Southwest\u2019s dividend growth to go essentially unchecked for years on end.</p> \n<p>Southwest\u2019s (LUV) Dividend Is Cleared for Takeoff<br> Brunswick Corporation (BC)<br> Dividend Yield: 1.2%<br> 5-Year Dividend Growth: 300%<br> Forward P/E: 12.3</p> \n<p>Brunswick Corporation (BC)isn\u2019t a household name, but it has brought more fun to Americans than just about any company not named Disney (DIS).</p> \n<p>Brunswick is the name behind watercraft brands such as Bayliner, Flipper and Meridian Yachts; fitness products under brands such as LifeFitness and Indoor Cycling; and billiards under its namesake Brunswick brand.

That sum, which excludes banks, is more than before the Great Recession \u2014 or any other time in history. Companies have used that debtto invest in the future, make splashy acquisitions and reward shareholders with a bonanza of stock buybacks. But this is a dicey time to owe a bunch of money. After years of extraordinarily low interest rates, borrowing costs are finally on the rise. That makes it more expensive for companies to refinance their debt when it comes due. Those costs will only rise further if inflation heats up, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates more rapidly. The US economy is cruising. The economic expansion is already the second-longest in history. But another recession will come eventually. In previous downturns, companies with too much debt have found it difficult to repay their loans, forcing some into bankruptcy. The \"massive amount of debt\" that American companies have piled on \"should concern investors as we enter the late innings of a credit cycle in a rising rate environment,\" S&P analyst Andrew Chang wrote in a report last week. Of course, Corporate America has more firepower than ever to pay down debt. The strengthening economy and the Republican corporate tax cut have combined to unlock vast amounts of money for companies. Indeed, S&P found that by the end of 2017, the 1,900 US companies that it rates, excluding banks, had accumulated a whopping $2.1 trillion in cash. That's up 9% from the year before \u2014 and more than double what they were sitting on in 2009. However, that pile of money is not evenly divided. In fact, the richest 1% of US companies control more than half of the cash, S&P said. As of the end of 2017, justseven companies claimed $800 billion of cash: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), AT&T (T) and Amgen (AMGN). Althoughthe tax law has improvedcorporate balance sheets, it's also sparked a record-setting wave of share buybacks and debt-fueled acquisitions. S&P said it believes Corporate America has reached its peak for cash hoarding. That's because companies are rewarding shareholders while adding debt because of the \"lure of cheap money.\" \"We believe we are now entering the era of the Great Unwinding,\" Chang wrote. Companies that have strong balance sheets can afford to return a bunch of cash to shareholders. The rest? Not so much. S&P found that the riskiest category of borrowers \u2014 with a rating known as junk \u2014 have never been more leveraged than they are right now. They're holding $8 of debt for every $1 of cash. What could possibly go wrong? 2. Jobs report: How much tighter can the US labor market get? We'll find out Friday, when the Labor Department releases the June jobs report. Unemployment is already 3.8%, the lowest since 2000. If it drops again, it will be the lowest in half a century. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters are expecting a solid gain of 200,000 jobs. 3. Trade showdown:This is the week when President Donald Trump's trade fight with China gets real. On Friday, US customs agents will begin collecting a 25% tariff on about 800 Chinese goods worth $34 billion, the first wave of a $50 billion round of trade penalties. Those goods include jet engines, batteries and industrial dryers. On the same day, China will impose a tariff on $34 billion of American exports, including cars and beef. For investors, the big risk is escalation. Trump has threatened tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of additional goods. And China has vowed to fight a trade war \"to the end.\" 4. Why the Fed is hiking rates: When the Fed reports its meeting minutes Thursday, we'll get a closer look at why the central bank is more optimistic about the economy \u2014 and eager to raise rates faster than it initially planned. Last month, the Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the second hike this year. A majority of the Fed's Board of Governors said they now expect a total of four interest rate increases this year. Fed officials had been split about whether to raise rates three times this year or four. 5. Xiaomi prices its IPO:Once the most valuable startup on the planet, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is about to go public. The company plans to raise $4.7 billion in its IPO, a person familiar with the IPO told CNNMoney. That's at the bottom of its planned range. Earlier this year, Xiaomi was reported to seek as much as $10 billion from the listing. The IPO, which is scheduled to price on Friday, would values Xiaomi at about $54 billion -- not a huge leap from the $45 billion at which Xiaomi was valued in a private funding round in late 2014. Xiaomi's shine dimmed because investors worry about its potential to grow its profit, because it caters the lower end of the increasingly saturated smartphone market. 6.

A variance-covariance matrix is particularly useful when it comes to analysing the volatility between elements of a group of data. For instance, a variance-covariance matrix has particular applications when it comes to analysing portfolio returns. If several assets with a high covariance are included in a portfolio, then this represents high risk. This indicates that several assets with high volatility move together, which is what investors would typically want to avoid. On the other hand, selecting assets that show negative covariance allows for greater diversification of the portfolio, since the volatility of the assets do not tend to move together. First, we install our libraries. We then load the corpcor, tseries and quantmod libraries into the environment. For the purpose of this variance-covariance matrix, let us stream stock data with quantmod to analyse the following five stocks: Now, we need to: Now, we store these within data frames and obtain the differences of the logs: We then combine each stock into the one data frame named portfolio: Now, let us generate a 5 x 5 covariance matrix: The readings above indicate the extent to which the volatility in prices move together. For instance, we can see that the volatility between AAPL and VZ is significantly less than that between AAPL and GOOGL, since the latter are both technology stocks. It is often the case that if we have too few observations in our data (which we arguably do given we are using 30 days of data), then our covariance estimates will be unreliable. To remedy this, we can use what is called a shrinkage estimate of covariance. This works by ensuring that our covariance matrix is positive definite, i.e. one where all eigenvalues are real and positive. When we shrink the covariance matrix, we end up with the following: Once we have ensured that our covariance matrix is positive definite, we can convert it into a correlation matrix - i.e. determine the extent to which returns move together rather than volatility.

Last month, Facebook (FB) invited intelligence officials and representatives of Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and other major players to its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The objective, according to a source at the meeting, was to get federal authorities to share information that could help tech companies combat coming threats. That didn't happen. As first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by CNN, FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials repeatedly refused to share any information about foreign actors and what they might be up to. Instead, the meeting reinforced Silicon Valley's worst suspicions about Washington. The tech companies left the meeting feeling like the feds are withholding vital insights that could help curb foreign meddling---and therefore failing to protect national security, sources with knowledge of the matter said. \"The agencies tasked with defending our country are pointing to Silicon Valley and saying, 'This is your problem,'\" one source who attended the meeting said. \"They're saying, 'We're going to take our ball and go home but you're responsible for the outcome of a game.\" Silicon Valley sources considered it telling that Facebook, not the Department of Homeland Security, organized the meeting. \"It is galling that Facebook had to take the lead,\" the source said. Washington officials maintain that Facebook, Google and other big tech firms are better equipped to monitor foreign activity on their platforms because they can access the data and see where such activity originates. They also believe that these companies bear ultimate responsibility for what happens on their platforms. Representatives of Facebook, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security did not comment for this story. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has launched a massive effort to combat foreign meddling and misinformation on its platform by, among other things, revamping its security policies and dedicating 20,000 people to \"security and content review.\" But even CEO Mark Zuckerberg concedes that \"security isn't a problem that you ever fully solve.\" Asked by CNN's Laurie Segall in March if bad actors are trying to meddle in the 2018 midterms, Zuckerberg said, \"I'm sure someone's trying. Right? And I'm sure that there's V2, version two of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016. I'm sure they're working on that.\" Facebook and other tech firms believe that gaining access to information gleaned by the FBI and Homeland Security would make it easier to address the problem. But the intelligence community, already reluctant to share information among its various agencies and divisions, appears to be even less interested in sharing with anyone beyond the national security apparatus. If there is one area both sides agree on, it's that the Trump administration has failed to take the lead on this issue and develop a comprehensive response to foreign information warfare.

There have been tons of funereal stories about GE (GE) getting kicked out of the Dow after 111 years. But there haven't been as many about the \"new kid\" in the Dow -- Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). You've probably already heard of -- and shopped at -- a Walgreens. It's the giant drug store chain that first set up shop in Chicago in 1901... six years before GE began its more than century long stretch in the Dow. But what's up with the Boots Alliance name? Well, it refers to the company's other big business. Walgreens bought British-based Alliance Boots in 2015. Boots is a drugstore retailer and Alliance is a drug wholesale and distribution company. It's a company worth $66 billion that pulled in revenue of $33 billion and an operating profit of nearly $2 billion in its last quarter. And Walgreens is getting even bigger. It finally completed the purchase of more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores in March. That deal had been in regulatory limbo for years and Walgreens actually abandoned earlier plans to buy a bigger chunk of Rite Aid stores before agreeing to a new, smaller deal that finally passed antitrust muster. Thanks in part to the Boots and Rite Aid deals, analysts expect Walgreens' earnings per share to increase at a 12% rate, on average, for the next few years. In other words, the Dow is adding a healthy, if not particularly sexy or exciting company. But it's one that isn't shrinking. Shares of Walgreens are up about 50% over the past five years while GE's stock has plunged 45%. With a price hovering around $67, Walgreens is now the 23rd biggest (or eighth-smallest if you're a half glass empty type) company in the Dow. Walgreens is just below Nike (NKE) and right above DowDuPont (DWDP). The Dow ranks its companies by stock price, not market value like the S&P 500. So even though GE is still valued at $111 billion, compared to a market cap of $66 billion for Walgreens, GE was the tiniest company in the Dow by far because its stock price had tumbled all the way to the low teens. With GE getting shown the Dow door, drug maker Pfizer (PFE), with a price just above $36 a share, inherits the title of the Dow member with the smallest weighting. Still, the addition of Walgreens is a bit curious. It might make sense that more dynamic (and arguably more important) companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) won't be added to the Dow because they have share prices above $1,000 and would put the Dow weighting severely out of whack. But it's worth asking why CVS (CVS) -- Walgreen's top rival -- wasn't added instead. CVS, trading at about $71 a share, would have about the same weighting as Walgreens. And CVS is a more diverse company by virtue of its ownership of the Caremark pharmacy benefits management firm. CVS also generated more revenue than Walgreens last year and is worth more, too. What's more, CVS could soon become even bigger and more diversified thanks to its plan to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for $67 billion. Sure the Dow already lists Aetna rival UnitedHealth (UNH) But that shouldn't matter. The Dow includes banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) in it, not to mention Pfizer competitors Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). It includes Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), too. A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices had no comment on why Walgreens was chosen for the Dow instead of CVS. But when the decision to get rid of GE and Walgreens was made, S&P Dow Jones Indices said the move will make the Dow more \"representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the US economy\" and a \"better measure of ... the stock market.\" Adding CVScouldhave accomplished the same thing though.", "publishDate": "2018-06-26T00:00:00", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p> General Electric, as of Tuesday morning, is no longer in the Dow. </p> \n <p> There have been tons of funereal stories about GE (GE) getting <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/19/investing/ge-dow-jones-walgreens/index.html\">kicked out of the Dow</a> after 111 years.

Walgreens bought British-based Alliance Boots in 2015. Boots is a drugstore retailer and Alliance is a drug wholesale and distribution company. </p> \n <p> It's a company worth $66 billion that pulled in revenue of $33 billion and an operating profit of nearly $2 billion in its last quarter. </p> \n <p> And Walgreens is getting even bigger. It finally completed the purchase of more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores in March. </p> \n <p> That deal had been in regulatory limbo for years and Walgreens actually abandoned earlier plans to buy a bigger chunk of Rite Aid stores before agreeing to a new, smaller deal that finally passed antitrust muster. </p> \n <p> Thanks in part to the Boots and Rite Aid deals, analysts expect Walgreens' earnings per share to increase at a 12% rate, on average, for the next few years. </p> \n <p> In other words, the Dow is adding a healthy, if not particularly sexy or exciting company. </p> \n <p> But it's one that isn't shrinking. </p> \n <p> Shares of Walgreens are up about 50% over the past five years while GE's stock has plunged 45%. </p> \n <p> With a price hovering around $67, Walgreens is now the <a href=\"http://indexarb.com/indexComponentWtsDJ.html\">23rd biggest</a> (or eighth-smallest if you're a half glass empty type) company in the Dow. Walgreens is just below Nike (NKE) and right above DowDuPont (DWDP). </p> \n <p> The Dow ranks its companies by stock price, not market value like the S&amp;P 500. So even though GE is still valued at $111 billion, compared to a market cap of $66 billion for Walgreens, GE was the tiniest company in the Dow by far because its stock price had tumbled all the way to the low teens. </p> \n <p> With GE getting shown the Dow door, drug maker Pfizer (PFE), with a price just above $36 a share, inherits the title of the Dow member with the smallest weighting. </p> \n <p> Still, the addition of Walgreens is a bit curious. </p> \n <p> It might make sense that more dynamic (and arguably more important) companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) won't be added to the Dow because they have share prices above $1,000 and would put the Dow weighting severely out of whack. But it's worth asking why CVS (CVS) -- Walgreen's top rival -- wasn't added instead. </p> \n <p> CVS, trading at about $71 a share, would have about the same weighting as Walgreens. </p> \n <p> And CVS is a more diverse company by virtue of its ownership of the Caremark pharmacy benefits management firm. CVS also generated more revenue than Walgreens last year and is worth more, too. </p> \n <p> What's more, CVS could soon become even bigger and more diversified thanks to its plan to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for $67 billion. </p> \n <p> Sure the Dow already lists Aetna rival UnitedHealth (UNH) But that shouldn't matter. </p> \n <p> The Dow includes banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) in it, not to mention Pfizer competitors Merck (MRK) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ). It includes Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), too. </p> \n <p> A spokesman for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices had no comment on why Walgreens was chosen for the Dow instead of CVS. </p> \n <p> But when the decision to get rid of GE and Walgreens was made, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said the move will make the Dow more \"representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the US economy\" and a \"better measure of ... the stock market.\" </p> \n <p> Adding CVScouldhave accomplished the same thing though. </p> \n</div>", "score": 6.087622, "discoverDate": "2018-06-26T13:19:50.735+0000", "highlight": ").

And the odds are, you do too. Because, face it -- we all spend too much time staring at our phones. Apple wants to help us with that. Beginning today, anyone with an iPhone 5S and later can glean detailed information about just how often, and for how long, they interact with their device. On Monday, Apple (AAPL) released the public beta of iOS 12, the latest version of its mobile operating system. It includes a suite of features designed to track your phone usage and help you cut down on screen time. Apple is the latest company to address a mounting issue created by its own products. \"Time well spent\" is the hot catchphrase in Silicon Valley as tech titans like Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) roll out features to help people make better use of their time. I've spent two weeks using iOS 12, and although it hasn't changed my habits just yet, I am much more aware of -- and anxious about -- my relationship with my phone. The new operating system is available now as a beta (which almost certainly includes bugs and isn't recommended for most users) and coming to everyone later this year. It includes performance improvements, group FaceTime calls, customizable Animoji's that look like you, and new augmented reality powers. But the central feature is Screen Time. The tool, found under settings, tallies the time you spend on your phone by day and week, and breaks it down by app and category. It shows how many notifications you receive and how often you pick up your phone (I grab mine every six minutes). You receive all this info in a convenient weekly report that makes it hard to deny you just might have a problem. \"Each person has to make the decision when they get their numbers as to what they would like to do,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNN when he announced the feature last month. After reading my reports, I decided to cut down on social media, which sucked up six hours of my week. I used the Screen Time tools to limit my daily time on Twitter (TWTR) and Instagram and all the rest to just 15 minutes. I soon upped it to one hour, because Screen Time takes its job very seriously. Hit your self-imposed limit and the screen goes gray, making it impossible to see the app. You have the option to extend your time by 15 minutes or waive the limit for the day. I quickly formed a habit of repeatedly hitting the snooze button while thumbing through Twitter, and eventually just turned off the feature entirely. Another feature, called \"Do Not Disturb,\" lets you shut down all your notifications and calls. You can schedule regular blackouts, or simply let your phone shut them down automatically based upon your location, your calendar, and more. I opted to schedule my executive time from 6pm to 9pm, when I'm usually ignoring my phone anyway. That still didn't stop me from peeking at the screen. I couldn't help it. You probably can't, either. \"The biochemistry of your brain is urging you to check in. That's really hard to change,\" said Dr. Larry Rosen, a psychologist and author who focuses on how people use technology. Stop looking at your phone, he says, and your anxiety mounts. It's called nomophobia, the fear of being without your phone, although you might know it as FOMO--fear of missing out. Apple isn't alone in trying to help people with this. Google unveiled similar features for Android, and Facebook is testing time-tracking and alarms in its apps. Such features are the first baby steps toward changing how people use technology. They won't solve the mounting problem of tech addiction, but Rosen says they'll make people aware of the problem. He's got a point. Seeing just how much time I spend thumbing my phone was sobering, if not entirely helpful. Screen Time, like the Android features, doesn't provide any context for the data, no suggestions for how I might change my behavior, no clues to what's normal or even acceptable. It's hard to know, looking at my weekly report, if 36 hours and change on my phone is dangerously high, or just mildly excessive. Rosen says his research shows that young adults spend about five hours a day on their devices and glance at them 50 to 60 times. A survey from Deloitte put that figure at 47 times daily. As for me, Screen Time tells me I pick up my iPhone X a whopping 75 times a day. That shocked me almost as much as learning I look at the damned thing every six minutes. But without knowing where I sit on the bell curve of phone use, it's hard to know what to do. \"If we want to change how people are habitually interacting with their phone, just giving them more numbers is not going to cut it,\" said Ramsay Brown, a neuroscientist and COO of Boundless Mind. His company makes software designed to change user behavior, including a tool called Space that forces you to wait for apps to launch. If you want to make the jump from being aware of your behavior to changing it, Brown suggests starting with fewer notifications. Apple has new features to help with that. iOS 12 provides more granular control over silencing notifications from some apps, or grouping them in a \"stack\" so one alert notifies you of the 25 comments left on your latest Instagram post. Siri also will suggest changes to your settings based upon your behavior. All of that should help, because those infernal notifications trigger half of all phone pickups, Rosen says. If you want to do more, weed out the apps you're most likely to waste time on (Goodbye, Twitter! See you later, Slack!) by burying them inside a folder or deleting them entirely. And finally, go easy on yourself. Don't try to make radical changes all at one. I tried limiting myself to 15 minutes on Twitter, than an hour. That plan that quickly fell apart. Rather than beat myself up, I'll try using it just a little less, paying more attention to the people around me, and maybe deleting a few apps. It may not work. But at least Screen Time has made me aware of the problem.

In addition to the Placing, Mayan has also agreed to issue US$175,000 of new ordinary shares at a price of 0.7p per share in settlement of outstanding creditors ('Settlement Shares'). Acquisition of seven vertical Stockdale wells and five Austin Chalk wells 7 Stockdale Wells (Working Interest 60%/ Net Revenue Interest 45%) \u00b7 Provides multiple opportunities to replicate the success of the Morris#1 well at the Stockdale field which has been producing at a gross rate of over 80bopd following a low cost workover \u00b7 Production at Stockdale is highly profitable due to low operational costs which at current oil prices generates excellent netbacks o All-in operating costs at Morris#1 are expected to average less than US$14 per barrel based on an expected production level of 2,760 gross BOPD over a 30-day month \u00b7 Low cost development programme will involve reworking Stockdale wells using the techniques and technologies that were successfully deployed on the Morris #1 well o All seven vertical wells will be completed in both upper and lower Anacacho zones as well as the lower Escondido sand where the Morris#1 encountered natural gas o Water to be piped into existing salt water disposal well ('SWD') o Due to work previously undertaken by Mayan to get the SWD well operational it will be able to quickly workover and tie-in production from new wells 5 Austin Chalk Wells (Working Interest 60%/ Net Revenue Interest 50.25%) \u00b7 Near term workover and exploitation potential on three Austin Chalk horizontal wells and two vertical wells using low-cost techniques proven on Morris #1 well \u00b7 The Company intends to use a coiled tubing rig to clean out; work-over; and, acidize Austin Chalk zone in each of the horizontal laterals with estimated potential production of 60-80 barrels per day per well \u00b7 The Company estimates that the workover and acidization procedure on each well will require no more than two days rig time allowing for near term, high impact results to be realized \u00b7 Longer-term potential to re-frac wells targeting zones identified with the Roke Quad Neutron log tool \u00b7 None of the wells have been re-entered or stimulated in any way suggesting significant upside potential from low cost stimulation and production enhancement techniques and technologies \u00b7 The Company has established a 300 bopd (Gross) target from the five well package with potential for upside if the Company achieves the higher end of its expectation range on each well \u00b7 Operating cost per barrel estimated to be US$18-20 per barrel as water from these wells will be transported via truck for disposal Update on Forest Hill Field work programme \u00b7 Workovers on an additional 2 - 4 producing wells at Forest Hill Field due to recommence in July 2018 - follows satisfactory resolution of issues relating to access and rights regarding certain leases with a neighbouring operator \u00b7 Production at Forest Hill is highly profitable due to low costs which at current oil prices generates excellent netbacks o Realised oil price is WTI plus US$2.00 o All-in operating costs are expected to average less than US$15 per barrel of oil based on an expected production level of 5,730 gross BOPD over a 30 day month Eddie Gonzalez, Managing Director, said: 'Whilst the SPA remains conditional on the agreement of the JOA and completion of due diligence, Mayan is confident of closing the Acquisition given its knowledge of the formations and work done to date on the Transaction. With the potential addition of these 12 new wells plus ongoing work programmes at Forest Hill and now at Zink Ranch we are well positioned to push daily production towards our target range of 300 to 500 net bopd. Our technical team has successfully demonstrated the capability to achieve excellent results by exploiting existing well bores using cutting-edge and proprietary tools and techniques. Thanks to today's agreement, our team now has many more opportunities to replicate this success. I expect Stockdale and the nearby Gonzalez County wells to form the backbone of our production, augmented by important contributions from Forest Hill and Zink Ranch. 'Importantly following my appointment, Mayan today is a streamlined organisation with low overheads. Together with our growing production base, we are able to deploy the majority of our new capital into the ground to add yet more production and in turn drive Mayan's profitability and future growth. We now have an inventory of wells with which to take the next major step forward in terms of building the scale an oil and gas company requires to be successful over the long term. With work progressing across our asset base, the summer and the fall of 2018 will not be short of high impact news flow.'

It's less than the $10 billion Xiaomi was reportedly hoping to achieve a few weeks ago, but would still make it the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in nearly two years. \"In the future, Xiaomi has huge potential for growth,\" CEO Lei Jun said at a news conference in Hong Kong. \"We're a very rare company that can do hardware, e-commerce and internet services.\" Xiaomi said it's aiming to sell almost 2.2 billion shares to global investors this week for between 17 and 22 Hong Kong dollars each ($2.20 to $2.80). James Paradise, an Asia-Pacific president at Goldman Sachs (FADXX), which is one of the IPO's sponsors, said Saturday that the range values Xiaomi between $54 billion and $70 billion. That's lower than the valuation of close to $100 billion the company was reportedly seeking earlier this year. \"We never said how much we were valued,\" CFO Chew Shou Zi said at the news conference. \"In the last several months, the market had a lot of speculation.\" Hao Hong, chief strategist at Hong Kong-based broker BOCOM International, said one explanation for the lower valuation was that investors were concerned about Xiaomi's potential to increase its profit margins in the future. \"The explosion of Xiaomi has been at the low end of the market. It's not taking the premium end of the market like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF). That's why its profit margins are very difficult to expand,\" he said. Trading in Xiaomi shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange is expected to start on July 9. The company plans to use the cash from the IPO to increase its research and development and for global expansion. The listing is also expected to make some of the tech company's cofounders and early employees extremely wealthy. In a recent filing, Xiaomi said it had awarded Lei, the CEO and cofounder, stock worth about $1.5 billion for his contributions to the company. Xiaomi defended the huge award on Saturday, saying it's a common practice. \"We reached a consensus to make the decision because of Lei's devotion over the last eight years, he started the company from scratch,\" said Xiaomi President Lin Bin, another cofounder. Xiaomi had also planned to simultaneously list shares in mainland China in addition to Hong Kong but will now onlygo public in the latter. The company said it planned to revisit the possibility of a listing in mainland China at a later date. The company's IPO will bethe biggest in the worldsince Postal Savings Bank of China went public in September 2016, according to data provider Dealogic. A wave of other huge Chinese tech companies are also reportedly considering going public in the next year, including online payments giant Ant Financial. Founded in 2010, Xiaomi was the fifth biggest smartphone maker in the world last year, shipping more than 92 million devices, according to research firm IDC. Xiaomi's main business is phones, but it also makes a range of other internet-connected devices, including laptops and even smart rice cookers. The company says it sells its products in 74 countries and regions. It has enjoyed particularly strong growth in India, where it has overtaken Samsung as the biggest selling smartphone maker. It is also currently the fourth largest smartphone company in Europe, behind Samsung, Apple and Chinese rival Huawei, according to research firms IDC and Canalys. It's competing strongly in Spain, Greece and Russia. Documents that Xiaomi it published last month showed that revenue soared nearly 70% last year to around 115 billion yuan ($18 billion). Operating profit more than tripled to 12 billion yuan ($1.9 billion). Xiaomi made headlines in 2014 when it became the world's most valuable startup. But the company then ran into trouble, suffering a drop in smartphone sales in 2016 as it struggled with supply chain problems. -- Sherisse Pham and Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "publishDate": "2018-06-23T00:00:00", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p> The Chinese tech firm announced the planned value of the listing Saturday.

In fact, most of you probably can\u2019t even pronounce it correctly. It\u2019s \u201chwah-way,\u201d by the way. But it turns out this Chinese smartphone maker is more than capable of producing a laptop to rival the best on the market, even if it does look like Huawei lifted its design from Apple\u2019s (AAPL) MacBook. Dubbed the MateBook X Pro, this machine is so powerful and, at $1,199 compared to $1,499 for a similarly-equipped MacBook Pro, so relatively inexpensive that it feels like it shouldn\u2019t exist at all. It\u2019s got some problems, namely a goofy webcam hidden below the keyboard that\u2019s difficult to use. Oh, and Huawei\u2019s new reputation as a national security threat is sure to turn off some shoppers. But for the money, this laptop is one of the best you can buy. An aluminum beauty The MateBook X Pro is a stunning machine. Built using an aluminum chassis that prevents it from flexing or creaking, the X Pro is available in both silver and space grey. For my money, the latter is the one to go with. Sporting a slim design, the X Pro packs a 13.9-inch display, which puts it in between Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro 13-inch and MacBook Pro 15-inch. Still, Huawei\u2019s X Pro is as wide and a hair thinner than the MacBook Pro 13-inch. And while it feels a bit heavy, the X Pro is actually lighter than the Pro 13-inch. The X Pro looks just about as close to a MacBook as possible. Two details give away the fact that this isn\u2019t a Mac: the Huawei logo on the laptop\u2019s lid and the ridiculously thin display bezel. This thing is virtually all glass. That screen, though The MateBook\u2019s screen is more than just its thin bezel, though. The touch screen panel, yes it\u2019s touch and still thin, offers a resolution of 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. That\u2019s sharper than the MacBook Pro 13-inch\u2019s and 15-inch\u2019s screens. Dell\u2019s incredible XPS 13, however, offers a sharper 13-inch panel with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160, though you need to pay $400 to upgrade to that display. Colors on the MateBook X Pro look spectacular. Even the Windows 10 screensavers looked fantastic. I spent several hours poring over trailers from E3 2018, which I swear was definitely for research, and not just because I wanted to watch game video game trailers while at work, and they looked brilliant. The camera is where? We all know someone who covers their webcam with either a small Post-it note or piece of tape out of fear that someone will hack their computer and watch them read their emails and eat their sad packed lunch hunched over their desks. No? Just me? Anyway, Huawei has decided that slapping a Post-it on your sleek new laptop is probably the last thing you want to do. It also didn\u2019t have any space for a webcam on the MateBook X Pro\u2019s super-thin bezels. Rather than putting the camera directly below the display like Dell does on its XPS 13, Huawei has hidden it under a special button in the keyboard\u2019s F6 and F7 keys. Pressing down on the button flips it up so you can begin chatting. It\u2019s a novel idea that certainly eliminates any need for a Post-it to cover the camera, but it also means that whoever you\u2019re chatting with will get a good look up your nose much like the XPS 13. And God help you if you have to type something while using the webcam, because your friend will just get a close-up look at your fingernails. I sincerely hope you get a manicure before using this webcam. Performance to spare What makes the MateBook X Pro such a standout machine is the incredible amount of power it\u2019s packing at such a low price. The base model comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and integrated Intel graphics for $1,199. It also features two USB C ports, one of which supports Thunderbolt 3 so you can use it to connect an external full-size graphics card. Don\u2019t expect to be able to play AAA PC games on the MateBook at high settings, though. Even \u201cOverwatch,\u201d which is pretty forgiving when it comes to performance requirements, is sluggish when set to its max settings. Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro 13-inch starts at $1,299 and has a 128GB drive. The top-of-the-line X Pro comes with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce MX150 and 512GB of storage. That\u2019s a pretty beefy machine. A similarly outfitted MacBook Pro 13-inch without Touch Bar, which doesn\u2019t have an Nvidia chip, comes in at $2,199. Even Microsoft\u2019s 13.5-inch Surface Book 2, which offers similar specs to the MateBook, comes in at $1,349. Importantly, the MateBook X Pro offers plenty of battery life. I used the notebook throughout my workday while browsing the web and typing this very review and didn\u2019t have to plug it in until the end of the day. Wait, is it that Huawei? Finally, it\u2019s worth addressing the elephant in the room that is Huawei\u2019s current reputation in the U.S. Yes, the company\u2019s smartphones and telecommunications equipment are currently being treated as a security threat by the U.S. Government. The fear is that because Huawei is a Chinese company, the Chinese government could order it to create a backdoor program that would allow it to spy on U.S. citizens, more specifically U.S. government and military personnel. Nothing has come of those allegations as of yet, but it\u2019s been enough to spook major U.S. carriers into not carrying the company\u2019s devices. To address that, Huawei has loaded the MateBook X Pro with Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Windows 10 Signature Edition. In a statement a Huawei spokesperson said Signature restricts us from loading any software or apps. \u201cThis is an additional cost to the company but it demonstrates our commitment to privacy and security,\u201d the company said in a statement. What\u2019s more, the laptop\u2019s fingerprint reader, which is located on the power button, stores fingerprint data locally, rather than in the cloud. If that\u2019s not enough to make you feel safe in using the MateBook X Pro, then it\u2019s not for you. Should you get it? The Huawei MateBook X Pro is an exceptional laptop at a price that easily outclasses its competitors. It offers excellent performance, a long-lasting battery and a vibrant display \u2014 making the MateBook one of the best notebooks on the market. Its one downfall is its ridiculous webcam placement. But if you\u2019re able to look past that, and the company\u2019s own PR issues, the MateBook is the machine for you. By Daniel Howley", "publishDate": "2018-06-22T22:49:35", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>Huawei might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think of laptops. In fact, most of you probably can\u2019t even pronounce it correctly. It\u2019s \u201chwah-way,\u201d by the way.</p> \n <p>But it turns out this Chinese smartphone maker is more than capable of producing a laptop to rival the best on the market, even if it does look like Huawei lifted its design from Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL\">(AAPL)</a> MacBook.</p> \n <p>Dubbed <a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/us/tablets/matebook-x-pro/\">the MateBook X Pro</a>, this machine is so powerful and, at $1,199 compared to $1,499 for a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/\">similarly-equipped MacBook Pro</a>, so relatively inexpensive that it feels like it shouldn\u2019t exist at all. It\u2019s got some problems, namely a goofy webcam hidden below the keyboard that\u2019s difficult to use. Oh, and Huawei\u2019s new reputation as a national security threat is sure to turn off some shoppers. But for the money, this laptop is one of the best you can buy.</p> \n <p>An aluminum beauty</p> \n <p>The MateBook X Pro is a stunning machine. Built using an aluminum chassis that prevents it from flexing or creaking, the X Pro is available in both silver and space grey. For my money, the latter is the one to go with.</p> \n <p>Sporting a slim design, the X Pro packs a 13.9-inch display, which puts it in between Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro 13-inch and MacBook Pro 15-inch. Still, Huawei\u2019s X Pro is as wide and a hair thinner than the MacBook Pro 13-inch. And while it feels a bit heavy, the X Pro is actually lighter than the Pro 13-inch.</p> \n <p>The X Pro looks just about as close to a MacBook as possible. Two details give away the fact that this isn\u2019t a Mac: the Huawei logo on the laptop\u2019s lid and the ridiculously thin display bezel. This thing is virtually all glass.</p> \n <p>That screen, though</p> \n <p>The MateBook\u2019s screen is more than just its thin bezel, though. The touch screen panel, yes it\u2019s touch and still thin, offers a resolution of 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. That\u2019s sharper than the MacBook Pro 13-inch\u2019s and 15-inch\u2019s screens. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dells-xps-13-2018-easily-one-best-laptops-can-buy-213313789.html\">Dell\u2019s incredible XPS 13</a>, however, offers a sharper 13-inch panel with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160, though you need to pay $400 to upgrade to that display.</p> \n <p>Colors on the MateBook X Pro look spectacular. Even the Windows 10 screensavers looked fantastic. I spent several hours <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-coolest-games-e3-2018-153130476.html\">poring over trailers from E3 2018</a>, which I swear was definitely for research, and not just because I wanted to watch game video game trailers while at work, and they looked brilliant.</p> \n <p>The camera is where?</p> \n <p>We all know someone who covers their webcam with either a small Post-it note or piece of tape out of fear that someone will hack their computer and watch them read their emails and eat their sad packed lunch hunched over their desks. No? Just me?</p> \n <p>Anyway, Huawei has decided that slapping a Post-it on your sleek new laptop is probably the last thing you want to do. It also didn\u2019t have any space for a webcam on the MateBook X Pro\u2019s super-thin bezels.</p> \n <p>Rather than putting the camera directly below the display like Dell does on its XPS 13, Huawei has hidden it under a special button in the keyboard\u2019s F6 and F7 keys. Pressing down on the button flips it up so you can begin chatting.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s a novel idea that certainly eliminates any need for a Post-it to cover the camera, but it also means that whoever you\u2019re chatting with will get a good look up your nose much like the XPS 13. And God help you if you have to type something while using the webcam, because your friend will just get a close-up look at your fingernails. I sincerely hope you get a manicure before using this webcam.</p> \n <p>Performance to spare</p> \n <p>What makes the MateBook X Pro such a standout machine is the incredible amount of power it\u2019s packing at such a low price. The base model comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and integrated Intel graphics for $1,199. It also features two USB C ports, one of which supports Thunderbolt 3 so you can use it to connect an external full-size graphics card.</p> \n <p>Don\u2019t expect to be able to play AAA PC games on the MateBook at high settings, though. Even \u201cOverwatch,\u201d which is pretty forgiving when it comes to performance requirements, is sluggish when set to its max settings.</p> \n <p>Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro 13-inch starts at $1,299 and has a 128GB drive.</p> \n <p>The top-of-the-line X Pro comes with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce MX150 and 512GB of storage. That\u2019s a pretty beefy machine. A similarly outfitted MacBook Pro 13-inch without Touch Bar, which doesn\u2019t have an Nvidia chip, comes in at $2,199.</p> \n <p>Even Microsoft\u2019s 13.5-inch Surface Book 2, which offers similar specs to the MateBook, comes in at $1,349.</p> \n <p>Importantly, the MateBook X Pro offers plenty of battery life. I used the notebook throughout my workday while browsing the web and typing this very review and didn\u2019t have to plug it in until the end of the day.</p> \n <p>Wait, is it that Huawei?</p> \n <p>Finally, it\u2019s worth addressing the elephant in the room that is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/13/chinas-hauwei-top-us-intelligence-chiefs-caution-americans-away.html\">Huawei\u2019s current reputation in the U.S.</a> Yes, the company\u2019s smartphones and telecommunications equipment are currently being treated as a security threat by the U.S. Government.
