And while the long term tendency for analysts is to overstate earnings, there can also be non-synchronistic pessimism as it relates to laggards. This fact creates an imbalance between optimism and pessimism in financial markets, as analysts are not immune to the social pressure to pander to itching ears. In other words, analysts are prone to deliver rosy outlooks to well-performing sector peers, with inimical outlooks to underperformers. The energy sector\u2014and the oil sector in particular\u2014have encountered a rather lengthy downturn. Swift increases have given way to retracements, and the market clearing price per barrel has (over the past four years) rapidly eroded due to the varied dynamics of oil shale. This, in itself, should not have a long term impact on profitability. In the short term (measured over a handful of years) it has been disruptive. The question from an investment thesis is why invest in a laggard in the industry? ExxonMobil has underperformed the market on the basis of share price over the past few months. Reviewing fundamentals is a good place to start, but ultimately is not the answer for investors seeking to outperform the risk-adjusted market index (there is a concise aggregator to the myriad of fundamental ratios: price per share - which is to say that the equity price already largely reflects fundamental aspects). It is not therefore surprising to find some headwinds in the Exxon fundamental sail, given the relative stagnation of share price during a wild readjustment in the energy segment. Exxon is by far the biggest U.S. integrated oil company. There is little question that Exxon is at the mature phase as far as the business cycle goes, which means that production growth will be low (with EPS dynamically tied to price per barrel), and a relatively substantial portion of investor return will take place in the form of the dividend. A considerable aspect for share growth lays in the ability to increase dividend payments, which Exxon has done reliably for 36-years. The 6.5% dividend increase this year represents definite added value to the long term investor, as long as such dividend growth can be maintained in the future. There has been increasing indications that future technologies will become progressively less dependent on fossil fuels. The clearest market indication of this is Tesla (TSLA) who, at a Market Cap of $47B, is just $5B below GM. This is a remarkable statement of support by the market in favor of the long term necessity and sustainability of electric vehicles, given the fact that GM revenues are well over ten times Tesla\u2019s; Ford\u2019s net income is currently $10B more than Tesla\u2019s -2.3B (GM recently took a massive write-off due to taxes, so the comparative is less contiguous). The potential demise of oil would, of course, decrease investor value in the oil side of the energy sector. Consider this particular condition to be something of a nebulous risk; the degree to which we need to adjust our energy sources is a matter of great debate, and even if transportation predominantly shift to electric, this will merely increase demand for natural gas. There is no consensus forecast the has renewables capable of handling the majority of energy demand in the next twenty years. It is possible that we will move entirely away from oil, engage in a hybrid energy source, or discover a cleaner formula (either with oil, or hydrogen, or some other source) which the energy sector can pivot to. If the future of energy ends up being in chemical production on a large scale (which in some form or fashion seems likely) it seems likely that the energy infrastructure will provide the basis for new production. Think of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) pivoting to the cloud, among other paradigm shifting technologies. The future of energy consumption exists on the unpredictable long term horizon. Shorter term dilemmas relate to the dynamics between oil shale and traditional oil wells. Shale is much easier to deploy on the basis of relatively short term increases in oil price, as shale (though more expensive to drill) has a more compressed lifespan, which means it is less sensitive to price shocks. An increase back to $100 plus oil is not likely short term. It is probably not in the cards for the next several years. But a range of $70-$85 certainly is. A prolonged decrease to sub $50 oil is possible as well, though it is becoming progressively less and less likely at outlooks progress. The contrarian method revolves primarily around the idea that persistent, negative sentiment will sometimes give way to misevaluation of an equity. If the broad market is convinced that a stock is on its way up (which is the case anytime price is increasing) it becomes difficult for analysts to not succumb to the temptation to tell the people what they want to hear: if you tell people what they want to hear and are wrong, there is generally little consequence. If you tell them something that they do not want to hear (that they will lose money) you had better be right, and even then you will not necessarily be liked. This is a universal form of human peculiarity. When an entity in a beleaguered industry stagnates comparative to its peers, pessimism becomes more natural. The long state of underperformance can create an internal reluctance among the broad analytical population which will poison (or at least temper) projections. ExxonMobil, as a part of the integrated oil sector, has emerged from a multi-year hiatus to significant underperformance as compared to the broad market. Topped onto this, the new corporate tax rate (which is broadly beneficial to corporate bottom line) is not producing an immediate positive for Exxon. The current earnings call disclosed somewhere between $700-900M per quarter in hits associated with the tax change throughout the remainder of the year. On the contrary, companies more invested in refining such as Phillips 66 (PSX) and HollyFrontier Corp (HFC) have found themselves in a much more advantageous position to realize significant earnings growth, while simultaneously capturing tax gains. Still, increases in oil prices traditionally produce headwinds for refiners\u2019 margins. If you are not already holding shares, now may not be the time to gain entry (at least as far as a contrarian is concerned) in a refiner. This is not to say that a pure contrarian will outperform the market (if they did, we would soon all become contrarian), just that under certain circumstances a contrarian can. So can a value investor, or a technical trader, or any of the other hundred techniques. You do not use a wrench for every job. Sometimes a screw driver is superior, or a hammer. So the question here is not what the contrarian position is with regards to Exxon (and, frankly, a decision to buy Exxon right now may not technically even be contrarian\u2014though underperforming its market index, Exxon has nonetheless been appreciating) but rather whether the market attitude with regards to Exxon goes beyond neutral analysis into secular pessimism, which is the wheelhouse of contrarian gain. The integrated oil sector has underperformed the market by quite a bit over the past 5 years. Still, with competitor Chevron (CVX) appreciating significantly, this reality is clearly (in and of itself) not a hindrance to optimism. History can produce pricing drag, but it is easily be overcome by the combination of good earnings results and a positive sector outlook. An odd smattering of other factors has conspired to hold ExxonMobil down. The tax disadvantage is one, but again it is not entirely unique to Exxon. Another is the downfall of Rex Tillerson. The former Secretary of State under Donald Trump (which is a contentious position to begin with), Tillerson lost his title on March 31st. Not only was Tillerson widely linked in the media to his former job as CEO for ExxonMobil, but the contentious loss of his title has the intonation of costing ExxonMobil influence. It is impossible to create a discount on the basis of Tillerson\u2019s career in government, but that does not mean that it does not influence to some degree the subjective portion of analysts\u2019 conclusions. More directly influential is the stumbling from the starting block that Exxon has encountered following the resurgence in crude prices. Quarterly results inflect varying degrees of noise, but of note for Exxon investors was a short statement on the most recent conference call by Jeff Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations: \u201c Oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, a decrease of 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017\u2026[and] oil equivalent production decreased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\u201d Woodbury goes on to specify upcoming projects which underlies that the production shortage is not the result of a lack of resources to generate earnings, but instead reflects a shift in resource production that generated a transient production shortfall. Given the scope of ExxonMobil holdings it should be an easy explanation to accept, yet the market has so far proven conservative in assigning a premium on the basis of a forward ability to translate increasing oil prices into bottom line cash flow. When you are dealing with a low beta company, you should expect conservative price projections; it is possible that this (on a case-by-case basis) creates a correlation between stagnation as related to price appreciation, and the actual appreciation that will occur over the next few years. Conclusion When comparing integrated oil conglomerates Chevron and ExxonMobil, the delta in price appreciation between the two is striking. While Chevron has a more rosy growth outlook, it is certainly not worthy of the multi-digit percentage that relative price appreciation would indicate. There are three options here: that Chevron is overvalued and will fall back to Exxon levels (unlikely, unless oil prices significantly retract); that Exxon is in the midst of a double-digit decrease in earnings (itself highly unlikely); or that secular sources have produced headwinds to Exxon investor appreciation. I contend that the third option is the most likely. Ultimately future earnings will detail Exxon fortunes. Betting in the short term against secular motion is a fools game. For the long term investor, Exxon rewards the wait for a return to normative value with a 4% dividend. Disclosure: I am/we are long XOM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Revenue also surpassed my estimate of $61.3 billion, with the beat driven by broad-based performance across business lines. Operating income was $15.8 billion, in line with my estimate of $16 billion, as gross margin was positively impacted with cost reductions and a mix shift to services. Concerns over the performance of the iPhone X were clearly overblown, as the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model each week in the quarter. The midpoint of revenue guidance for FQ3 is ahead of consensus, and with iPhone X demand worries likely in the rear view mirror for now, the skies look clear for a steady rise in share price. With record Services revenue, growing contribution from Wearables and home products, and a healthy underlying iPhone segment, the Apple ecosystem is continually growing into a powerful behemoth. Combined with capital allocation tailwinds from a $100 billion share repurchase program and a 16% dividend increase, I continue to view Apple shares as attractive and maintain my BUYrating with a 12-month target price of $201, implying 13.8% upside. Negative read through from chip suppliers on iPhone performance in the quarter didn\u2019t materialize, as Apple sold 52.2 million iPhone units, up 2.9% y/y, in line with consensus of 52 million and higher than my estimate of 51.7 million. Total iPhone revenue was $38 billion, up 14.4% y/y, lower than my revenue estimate of $38.9 billion. Apple noted the iPhone X was the highest selling phone each and every week in FQ2, and reduced channel inventory by 1.8 million units, up 600,000 units from a year ago. The iPhone ASP also increased to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven by the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. IDC estimates that Apple gained smartphone market share with a 2.8% y/y increase and has a total market share of 15.6%. Management also called out strength in China, where the iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in the country, which augmented Apple to a 21% growth rate in region, their strongest y/y growth in 10 quarters. All of this points to healthy iPhone demand, which should continue to power Apple forward as the segment continues to be the most important driver for the company in the short term. I forecast iPhone revenue of $28.3 billion in FQ3, up 14% y/y, on units of 42.6 million sold, up 4% y/y. The Apple Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud had their best quarter ever in revenue. Services revenue of $9.1 billion, up 30.5% y/y, bested my estimate of $8.8 billion. Services revenue also came in higher than consensus of $8.4 billion. Management noted the number of paid subscriptions across services passed 270 million at the end of the quarter, totaling over 100 million incremental subscriptions y/y. iCloud storage revenue was up over 50% y/y to a new all time record, and Apple Music set a record for paid subscribers, totaling over 40 million. Apple Pay more than doubled its active users y/y with transactions tripling over the same time period. Apple Pay is currently available in 21 markets with upcoming launches scheduled for Norway, Poland, and the Ukraine over the next few months. Services is firing on all cylinders and are taking on a heightened vitality as Apple diversifies away from iPhone sales. Apple remains on track to double its 2016 service revenue by 2020, with few headwinds impeding blocking the runway. I estimate Apple will generate Service revenue of $9 billion in FQ3, up 24% y/y. iPad revenue of $4.1 billion, up 5.8% y/y, on units of 9.1 million, up 2.1% y/y, in line with my revenue estimate. For the fourth straight quarter, iPad revenue increased, with nearly half of the purchases coming from new customers. As management mentioned on the call, according to NPD, Apple has 53% of the U.S. tablet market, up from 40% a year ago. I expect the recently released iPad to help drive sales in FQ3, which has gotten great reviews thus far. I forecast iPad revenue of $5.1 billion in FQ3, up 4% y/y, on units of 11.4 million, up 0.3%. Mac generated revenue of $5.8 billion in revenue, up 0.1% y/y, on units of 4 million, down 2.9% y/y. This topped my estimate of $5.6 billion on 4.1 million units sold. Mac set new quarterly revenue records in both the Americas and China, in addition to achieving double digit growth in the active install base. 60% of Mac purchases in the quarter also came from new customers. I estimate Mac revenue of $6 billion in FQ3, up 8% y/y, on units of 4.3 million, up 2% y/y. Other Products revenue was $3.9 billion, up 37.6%, in line with my estimate. Unit sales of Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high in the quarter. Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods had combined revenue of nearly 50% y/y and on a trailing four quarter basis, Apple\u2019s wearables business has reached the size of a Fortune 300 company. HomePod was released in February, currently available in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. While there was minimal commentary on the call about it, I think HomePod could gain some traction over time. Amazon had a 72% market share of the total US install base of smart speakers last year, and while I don\u2019t expect Apple to surpass that, they likely could carve out a profitable niche with lower market share. AirPods is seeing incredible success with Apple trying to meet the demand, and HomePod could follow the same path, providing Apple with growing ancillary revenue. In FQ3, I project Other Products revenue will be $3.3 billion, up 22.5% y/y. Management also announced a new $100 billion share repurchase program they will start during the June quarter. Also of note, they mentioned their intention was to execute their program efficiently and at a fast pace. With an acquisition outside of tech could certainly happen, Apple is less likely to pursue significant M&A that could move the needle than going the route of share buybacks and dividends. Management does believe Apple\u2019s stock is undervalued, a sentiment I share with Apple trading at just 16x my 2018E EPS. Even with no definitive timeline, I think it\u2019s possible Apple could repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding stock by FY end 2019. The savings from tax reform create an opportunity for capital deployment, and the odds are minimal that Apple increases its dividend meaningfully to an annualized yield of 4-5%. Share repurchases provide the company more flexibility in timing, and Apple is more likely to pull that lever, especially at such current attractive levels. Share repurchases are a vital reason to be long Apple when looking at them in combination with a strong and healthy underlying core business. For FQ3, I estimate Apple will generate total revenue of $51.8 billion, up 14.3% y/y, and operating income of $12.1 billion, up 13.2% y/y. Apple remains largely tied to consumer spending. An economic slowdown would impact its top-line growth. Failure to innovate on a technological front could cause consumers to go elsewhere to a number of competitors. If the iPhone loses popularity with consumers, this would materially impact Apple\u2019s business. Current litigation risk with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), while highly unlikely, could lead to a ban on iPhone imports, which would be very materially adverse to the overall business. As Apple seeks to put repatriated cash to work, it may seek to acquire companies outside of its core competency and/or overpay, creating acquisition risk. With increasing capital returns a priority, failure to invest in Apple\u2019s core operations could jeopardize future cash returns to shareholders. For F2018, I estimate Apple will generate $262.3 billion in sales, up 14.4% y/y, led by the iPhone X and 8 models, with operating income of $67.8 billion, up 10.6% y/y, due to higher revenue and increased average selling prices driven by the iPhone X. Apple trades at 16x F2018E EPS, 15x F2018E free cash flow, and 14.1x F2018E operating income. Assigning a blended multiple of 18x F2018 EPS, 17x F2018E free cash flow and 16x F2018E operating income, results in a 12-month price target of $201, implied upside of 13.8%.

Revenue also surpassed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4142961-apple-long-term-benefits-repatriation-outweigh-soft-quarterly-guidance\">my</a> estimate of $61.3 billion, with the beat driven by broad-based performance across business lines. Operating income was $15.8 billion, in line with my estimate of $16 billion, as gross margin was positively impacted with cost reductions and a mix shift to services. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/for-apple-iphone-x-is-it-time-for-full-panic-mode-with-second-quarter-financial-results/\">Concerns</a> over the performance of the iPhone X were clearly overblown, as the iPhone X was the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4168271-apple-aapl-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">most popular</a> iPhone model each week in the quarter. The midpoint of revenue guidance for FQ3 is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3351077-apple-plus-4_4-percent-q2-beats-rev-eps-device-shipments-services-rev\">ahead</a> of consensus, and with iPhone X demand worries likely in the rear view mirror for now, the skies look clear for a steady rise in share price. With record Services revenue, growing contribution from Wearables and home products, and a healthy underlying iPhone segment, the Apple ecosystem is continually growing into a powerful behemoth. Combined with capital allocation tailwinds from a $100 billion share repurchase program and a 16% dividend increase, I continue to view Apple shares as attractive and maintain my BUYrating with a 12-month target price of $201, implying 13.8% upside.</p> \n <p>Negative read through from chip suppliers on iPhone performance in the quarter didn\u2019t materialize, as Apple sold 52.2 million iPhone units, up 2.9% y/y, in line with consensus of 52 million and higher than my estimate of 51.7 million. Total iPhone revenue was $38 billion, up 14.4% y/y, lower than my revenue estimate of $38.9 billion. Apple noted the iPhone X was the highest selling phone each and every week in FQ2, and reduced channel inventory by 1.8 million units, up 600,000 units from a year ago. The iPhone ASP also increased to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven by the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. IDC <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/02/idc-smartphone-shipments-q1-2018/\">estimates</a> that Apple gained smartphone market share with a 2.8% y/y increase and has a total market share of 15.6%. </p> \n <p>Management also called out strength in China, where the iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in the country, which augmented Apple to a 21% growth rate in region, their strongest y/y growth in 10 quarters. All of this points to healthy iPhone demand, which should continue to power Apple forward as the segment continues to be the most important driver for the company in the short term. I forecast iPhone revenue of $28.3 billion in FQ3, up 14% y/y, on units of 42.6 million sold, up 4% y/y.</p> \n <p>The Apple Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud had their best quarter ever in revenue. Services revenue of $9.1 billion, up 30.5% y/y, bested my estimate of $8.8 billion. Services revenue also came in higher than consensus of $8.4 billion. Management noted the number of paid subscriptions across services passed 270 million at the end of the quarter, totaling over 100 million incremental subscriptions y/y. iCloud storage revenue was up over 50% y/y to a new all time record, and Apple Music set a record for paid subscribers, totaling over 40 million. Apple Pay more than doubled its active users y/y with transactions tripling over the same time period. Apple Pay is currently available in 21 markets with upcoming launches scheduled for Norway, Poland, and the Ukraine over the next few months. Services is firing on all cylinders and are taking on a heightened vitality as Apple diversifies away from iPhone sales. Apple remains on track to double its 2016 service revenue by 2020, with few headwinds impeding blocking the runway. I estimate Apple will generate Service revenue of $9 billion in FQ3, up 24% y/y.</p> \n <p>iPad revenue of $4.1 billion, up 5.8% y/y, on units of 9.1 million, up 2.1% y/y, in line with my revenue estimate. For the fourth straight quarter, iPad revenue increased, with nearly half of the purchases coming from new customers. As management mentioned on the call, according to NPD, Apple has 53% of the U.S. tablet market, up from 40% a year ago. I expect the recently <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/03/apple-introduces-new-9-7-inch-ipad-with-apple-pencil-support/\">released</a> iPad to help drive sales in FQ3, which has gotten great <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/products/apple-ipad-2018-9-7-inch/review/\">reviews</a> thus far. I forecast iPad revenue of $5.1 billion in FQ3, up 4% y/y, on units of 11.4 million, up 0.3%. Mac generated revenue of $5.8 billion in revenue, up 0.1% y/y, on units of 4 million, down 2.9% y/y. This topped my estimate of $5.6 billion on 4.1 million units sold. Mac set new quarterly revenue records in both the Americas and China, in addition to achieving double digit growth in the active install base. 60% of Mac purchases in the quarter also came from new customers. I estimate Mac revenue of $6 billion in FQ3, up 8% y/y, on units of 4.3 million, up 2% y/y.</p> \n <p>Other Products revenue was $3.9 billion, up 37.6%, in line with my estimate. Unit sales of Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high in the quarter. Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods had combined revenue of nearly 50% y/y and on a trailing four quarter basis, Apple\u2019s wearables business has reached the size of a Fortune 300 company. HomePod was released in February, currently available in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. While there was minimal commentary on the call about it, I think HomePod could gain some traction over time. Amazon had a 72% market <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-updates-features-natural-interactions-2018-5\">share</a> of the total US install base of smart speakers last year, and while I don\u2019t expect Apple to surpass that, they likely could carve out a profitable niche with lower market share. AirPods is seeing incredible success with Apple trying to meet the demand, and HomePod could follow the same path, providing Apple with growing ancillary revenue. In FQ3, I project Other Products revenue will be $3.3 billion, up 22.5% y/y.</p> \n <p>Management also announced a new $100 billion share repurchase program they will start during the June quarter. Also of note, they mentioned their intention was to execute their program efficiently and at a fast pace. With an acquisition outside of tech could certainly happen, Apple is less likely to pursue significant M&amp;A that could move the needle than going the route of share buybacks and dividends. Management does believe Apple\u2019s stock is undervalued, a sentiment I share with Apple trading at just 16x my 2018E EPS. Even with no definitive timeline, I think it\u2019s possible Apple could repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding stock by FY end 2019. The savings from tax reform create an opportunity for capital deployment, and the odds are minimal that Apple increases its dividend meaningfully to an annualized yield of 4-5%. Share repurchases provide the company more flexibility in timing, and Apple is more likely to pull that lever, especially at such current attractive levels. Share repurchases are a vital reason to be long Apple when looking at them in combination with a strong and healthy underlying core business. For FQ3, I estimate Apple will generate total revenue of $51.8 billion, up 14.3% y/y, and operating income of $12.1 billion, up 13.2% y/y.</p> \n <p>Apple remains largely tied to consumer spending. An economic slowdown would impact its top-line growth. Failure to innovate on a technological front could cause consumers to go elsewhere to a number of competitors. If the iPhone loses popularity with consumers, this would materially impact Apple\u2019s business. Current <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/26/qualcomm-ceo-there-will-a-decision-on-apple-dispute-before-year-end.html\">litigation </a>risk with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\">QCOM</a>), while highly unlikely, could lead to a ban on iPhone imports, which would be very materially adverse to the overall business. As Apple seeks to put repatriated cash to work, it may seek to acquire companies outside of its core competency and/or overpay, creating acquisition risk. With increasing capital returns a priority, failure to invest in Apple\u2019s core operations could jeopardize future cash returns to shareholders.</p> \n <p>For F2018, I estimate Apple will generate $262.3 billion in sales, up 14.4% y/y, led by the iPhone X and 8 models, with operating income of $67.8 billion, up 10.6% y/y, due to higher revenue and increased average selling prices driven by the iPhone X. Apple trades at 16x F2018E EPS, 15x F2018E free cash flow, and 14.1x F2018E operating income. Assigning a blended multiple of 18x F2018 EPS, 17x F2018E free cash flow and 16x F2018E operating income, results in a 12-month price target of $201, implied upside of 13.8%.</p> \n <p></p> \n <span></span> \n <p>Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. </p> \n <p>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

There are different ways to play the supposed explosion of this promising market: innovative giants, chipmakers or diversified funds. 'Past performance is not indicative of future returns', but the assets presented have had good to stellar returns in up to today. To set the expectations right, this article is intended for you to build a watchlist. I strongly believe having a good watchlist is as important as correctly valuing a company. Let's say you're great at valuing companies and often you are able to initiate positions at exactly the right moment. If you don't have a substantial list of quality stocks to follow up on, you won't be able to generate enough great investment ideas. Therefore, I will give you 15 options you might consider if you want to bet that everything 'Artificial Intelligence' will become a big market. As a reminder: there are many more companies that will benefit from a rise in everything related to Artificial Intelligence. But I focus on some of the more logical choices. Before digging into the list, let's establish that A.I. is an umbrella term for many different emerging technologies. Source: Hackernoon Some of these technologies will merely enhance existing products and processes. Others will create entirely new products and services to sell to consumers and businesses. Nevertheless, analysts try to define and estimate the size of the market. It is estimated to grow exponentially in the next years. Many different studies say the global market of A.I. related products and services will be a multi-billion dollar market soon. The International Data Corporation (NYSE:ICD) says spending on A.I. solutions will reach $57 billion by 2021. The robotics market, mostly targeted to industrial businesses at this point, is expected to triple in less than 10 years. In 2017, it already had a market value of $14 billion. For those who want exposure to the trend of automation and robotics in particular, the two ETF's at the end of the article are very interesting (ROBO and BOTZ). The constant need for businesses to become more efficient is not new. However, we are nearing a tipping-point where machines can process some very complex tasks equally as well, or better, than human beings. The natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies are disrupting in the same way, namely making processes more efficient. Technologies like these will help people in the service economy work more efficiently or deliver better quality. Think about lawyers being able to prepare a case 2 times faster, because an algorithm helped them pick the best pieces of information. Products and services are being developed by start-ups and big corporations every day to cater this growing need of efficiency gains. It's hard to tell what will happen in the future, but now for sure that these new technologies will be exploited to create value for consumers and businesses alike. Most of the companies on this list simply have the volume of data and the technological capabilities to do good research on A.I. Others are simply suppliers to these giant data houses. They have the chips one needs to harness enough computing power. Many companies will use these new technologies to enhance their products. For example, let's take Netflix (NFLX). It has a lot of data it can process. We know that they make good use of this to tailor their offering to the end-consumer. Without a doubt, Netflix and many others will be able to improve their offering and efficiency by using Artificial Intelligence. However, my idea of the list is to include companies that will actually build a completely new product or service based on A.I., or cater directly to these companies (like chipmakers). At the end, I mention two funds focused on robotics. Most of the companies listed have the know-how, the data, the human capital and the financial power to build the next big A.I. thing. Being such a huge company comes with challenges, but provides great opportunities as well. Because of these two assumptions, which I personally think make sense, it's very likely that a couple of these companies will have superior technologies based on Artificial Intelligence in the future. Alphabet (GOOG) While Alphabet is one of the most well-known stocks in the world, not all its activities are equally well-known. Granted, the advertising business still accounts for 87% of its revenue, but it has been investing in and developing new sources of growth. One of these 'other bets', as they are called, is in Artificial Intelligence. One of these bets is a project called Maven. It's a program by the Pentagon to improve 'war fighting systems'. Over 3,100 employees of Google just signed a petition to stop involvement in the project. Whatever one thinks about the ethics or rational behind this program, it shows the leadership of Google in Artificial Intelligence. It has done this before, by beating the legendary game Go after it leveraged DeepMind's technology, a company it bought for $400 in 2014. Google Machine Learning program has been opened for free so anyone can experiment with it. In the beginning of April they added new features to TensorFlow. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft has a stronger focus on the hardware part of Artificial Intelligence. While they have similar platforms like Azure to harness the power of A.I. in the cloud, Microsoft has announced to integrate A.I. into every service and product the company offers. One example of this is the HoloLens. It's a high-quality headset with Augmented Reality capacity. The A.I. chip being developed for the HoloLens will be integrated in many other hardware products. The company even hints at licensing these chips to partners. An interesting development is the company's recently announced partnership with Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone producer. The companies have worked together since 2015, but now they have signed a strategic MoU about Artificial Intelligence. This could potentially be the beginning of Microsoft pushing back in the growing mobile market, which has been a disaster. Amazon (AMZN) Of course, Amazon has to be a part of this list. Amazon Machine Learning on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Machine Learning on Cortana were tied at the top spot for 2018 according to a Morgan Stanley analyst. The survey also showed 48% are testing or deploying A.I. and Machine Learning systems, up form 33% in 2017. Amazon is taking a similar route as Microsoft, recently announcing the development of A.I. chips to integrate into hardware such as the Echo and other Alexa supported hardware. The company has a strong footing in the voice powered applications of A.I. It also has plenty of data to work with. However, sometimes we forget the very obvious. Amazon is known for it's great logistics and has ample experience on warehouse scheduling. It shouldn't be a surprise the Amazon is investing heavily in robotics and automation to increase its own efficiency, but likely also to sell as products or services. Amazon already uses more than 100.000 robots in 25 of its 175 fulfillment centers worldwide. Apple (AAPL) Apple has beefed up its commitment to A.I. by stealing Google's A.I. expert John Giannadrea. Apple was one of the first companies getting serious about A.I. in the speech field with its Siri development. At the same time, Apple has been working on self-driving technology. The company has also made significant steps in face recognition. But other than that, you can't really call it a leader in this space (yet). But Apple has the data \u00e0nd the cash. Over the past 5 years, tech giants have bought 50 A.I. start-ups, and often paid good money for it, too. Apple snapped up 13 of these acquisitions. Still, many are waiting for a large acquisition or a clear stance on A.I. in the future. Facebook (FB) Every company discussed here has a lot of data, but Facebook remains a special one. In Q4 of 2017, the social media platform had 2.13 billion monthly active users. Of those, 1.4 billion log in daily. The data Facebook holds on nearly 1/4th of the worlds population is highly personal. Unfortunately, it seems the company has not always been a good guard-keeper of this data, referring to the Cambridge Analytica scandal of course. On top of that, Facebook also owns WhatsApp and Instagram. It's simply a giant when it comes to personal data. There aren't too many huge announcements about A.I. investments, but perhaps this is a strategy given the sensitivity of the data. Don't forget that Facebook also owns Oculus Rift, the VR company. Mark Zuckerberg is having a tough time explaining himself and the practices of the company to Congress. He says, A.I. will have to help solve the fake news problem. IBM (IBM) IBM has put a lot of effort into developing IBM Watson. In Q3 2017 it announced another $240 million investment in this business A.I. platform. If this works out, IBM will provide businesses with a suite of A.I. solutions, not relying on solely one product or service. The strategic imperatives business of IBM now makes up 43% of total revenue or $34 billion. IBM is came out with Q1 earnings on April 17th and has dropped 6% after-market. If you want to find the action abroad, there are other options out there. Baidu (BIDU) Something all Chinese companies have in common, is a good environment to set up far-reaching experiments. The Chinese government has a lot to say in the economy (this is an understatement), and it has decided to implement some ideas which would never pass Western standarts. I'm not making a value judgment here, but it's just a fact that societies in the West would not agree with these implementations. China has recently announced a plan to become the leader in A.I. in 2030. It has over 700 million internet users, many of which are using the all-incompassing app WeChat (which is a product of Tencent by the way). Even though Baidu announced they can mimic a voice after one minute of recording, many are not convinced it will be the next leader in the A.I. space. Of course, the company has a similar profile to other search engines such as Google and Yandex. It also offers videos, which it uses to do a lot of AI research on. Baidu only started a separate A.I. division last year. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) Perhaps a better pick in the booming Chinese market is Tencent. WeChat has a huge amount of data on Chinese citizens. Worldwide the app has over a billion users. Tencent is focused on three distinct areas: Robotics, Medical A.I. and 'general A.I.'. It has recently opened a new laboratory to develop robotics solutions. Granted, the vice president has said 'robotics' means everything connecting the real world with the actual world, like glasses or headphones for example. Alibaba (BABA) Alibaba has been investing in A.I. for a while now and recently it made headlines. It participated in another investment round for SenseTime, now 'the most valuable A.I. start-up in the world' according to some, valued at approximately $3 billion. The company has software that's tracking faces of millions of Chinese citizens on a daily basis. Believe it or not, a study estimated that China would have 626 million surveillance cameras running by 2020. Analysts believe SenseTime has government agencies as major clients, which is of course a good thing. Here we see, again, that the stance of the Chinese government, opening up huge data sets, is helping the company to develop its technology. This would not be possible in many other countries. Yandex (YNDX) Yandex is similar to Google or Baidu. In essence, it's a search engine that has developed new products and services around its main business. Yandex is focused on developing more efficient processes for industrial players. A good bet, as it's well known that Russia could do better in this regard. While international sanctions might hurt the Russian economy, it could very well stimulate further efficiency improvements driving by domestic firms. Needless to say, anything sensitive to national security will not easily be 'outsourced' by the Russians. Another reason to include Yandex in this list is the drop from the highs. The stock is currently trading around $34 while it used to trade at $41 in February. If you don't want to own these data-driven A.I. plays directly, consider chipmakers like Nvidia, Intel and Micron. I'm not going to go in detail on these companies, but they are often named as a play on Artificial Intelligence. All of them are chip producers. The logic is that, as Artificial Intelligence grows, the demand for advanced chips will follow. Please do your own due diligence, because these companies are influenced by a lot of different trends in the industry. For some, the cryptocurrency craze has momentarily inflated their sales and valuations. As you can see, all three companies have decent to good earnings growth and operating margins. Forward P/E EPS growth last 5Y Operating Margin NVDA 31.2 38.6% 31.4% INTC 13.42 7.8% 27.5% MU 5.12 44.2% 41.8% Source: Made by the author using Finviz Over the last few months, all these companies have easily beaten the S&P500 index. Surely there is some value in these. If you are more comfortable with a fund or ETF, here are two suggestions. These ETF's are more exposed to companies driving industrial automation and robotics. The first one, ROBO, is heavily overweight on the US and Japan (39% and 29%). BOTZ has the same strategy, but places 50% in Japan and 27% in the US. ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) Source: Robo factsheet Source: Robo factsheet BOTZ Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) Source: morningstar Source: BOTZ factsheet As you can see, there are many different ways to play to growing Artificial Intelligence market. All companies presented have to be reviewed on an individual basis, but investors should know there are many possibilities out there. The companies presented here have had good returns in the past and some of these will likely rise even more due to their efforts in Artificial Intelligence. It's impossible to know who will win the race, but we can almost say with certainty that one of these will make it big in A.I.

Granted, the advertising business still accounts for <a href=\"https://qz.com/1037542/alphabet-q2-2017-earnings-goog-in-charts/\">87% of its revenue</a>, but it has been investing in and developing new sources of growth. </p> \n <p>One of these 'other bets', as they are called, is in Artificial Intelligence. One of these bets is a project called Maven. It's a program by the Pentagon to improve 'war fighting systems'. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/04/google-employees-petition-ceo-to-drop-out-of-pentagon-ai-project/\">Over 3,100 employees of Google just signed a petition</a> to stop involvement in the project. Whatever one thinks about the ethics or rational behind this program, it shows the leadership of Google in Artificial Intelligence. </p> \n <p>It has done this before, by beating the legendary game Go after it leveraged DeepMind's technology, a company it bought for $400 in 2014.</p> \n <p>Google Machine Learning program has been opened for free so anyone can experiment with it. In the beginning of April they added new features to TensorFlow. </p> \n <p>Microsoft (MSFT)</p> \n <p>Microsoft has a stronger focus on the hardware part of Artificial Intelligence. While they have similar platforms like Azure to harness the power of A.I. in the cloud, Microsoft has announced to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/microsoft-harry-shum-excited-ai-driven-hardware/\">integrate A.I. into every service and product the company offers</a>. One example of this is the HoloLens. It's a high-quality headset with Augmented Reality capacity. </p> \n <p>The A.I. chip being developed for the HoloLens will be integrated in many other hardware products. The company even hints at <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/microsoft-working-on-ai-chips-across-different-devices-top-exec-says.html\">licensing these chips</a> to partners. </p> \n <p>An interesting development is the company's recently announced partnership with Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone producer. The companies have worked together since 2015, but now they have signed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/23/microsoft-and-xioami-to-collaborate-on-ai-cloud-computing-and-hardware/\">a strategic MoU</a> about Artificial Intelligence. This could potentially be the beginning of Microsoft pushing back in the growing mobile market, which has been a disaster. </p> \n <p>Amazon (AMZN)</p> \n <p>Of course, Amazon has to be a part of this list. Amazon Machine Learning on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Machine Learning on Cortana were tied at the top spot for 2018 according to <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-ai-spending/\">a Morgan Stanley analyst</a>. The survey also showed 48% are testing or deploying A.I. and Machine Learning systems, up form 33% in 2017.</p> \n <p>Amazon is taking a similar route as Microsoft, recently announcing the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-is-becoming-an-ai-chip-maker-speeding-alexa-responses\">development of A.I. chips</a> to integrate into hardware such as the Echo and other Alexa supported hardware. The company has a strong footing in the voice powered applications of A.I. It also has plenty of data to work with. </p> \n <p>However, sometimes we forget the very obvious. Amazon is known for it's great logistics and has ample experience on warehouse scheduling. It shouldn't be a surprise the Amazon is investing heavily in robotics and automation to increase its own efficiency, but likely also to sell as products or services. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-doubles-down-on-hybrid-humanrobot-workforce-in-illinois-warehouse/\">already uses more than 100.000 robots</a> in 25 of its 175 fulfillment centers worldwide. </p> \n <p>Apple (AAPL)</p> \n <p>Apple has beefed up its commitment to A.I. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1246586/apple-is-facing-its-toughest-fight-since-the-1980s/\">by stealing Google's A.I. expert John Giannadrea</a>. Apple was one of the first companies getting serious about A.I. in the speech field with its Siri development. At the same time, Apple has been working on self-driving technology. The company has also made significant steps in face recognition. But other than that, you can't really call it a leader in this space (yet). </p> \n <p>But Apple has the data \u00e0nd the cash. Over the past 5 years, <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/top-tech-companies-artificial-intelligence-expert-intelligence/\">tech giants have bought 50 A.I. start-ups</a>, and often paid good money for it, too. Apple snapped up 13 of these acquisitions. Still, many are waiting for a large acquisition or a clear stance on A.I. in the future. </p> \n <p>Facebook (FB)</p> \n <p>Every company discussed here has a lot of data, but Facebook remains a special one. In Q4 of 2017, the social media platform had 2.13 billion monthly active users. Of those, 1.4 billion log in daily. The data Facebook holds on nearly 1/4th of the worlds population is highly personal. Unfortunately, it seems the company has not always been a good guard-keeper of this data, referring to the Cambridge Analytica scandal of course. </p> \n <p>On top of that, Facebook also owns WhatsApp and Instagram. It's simply a giant when it comes to personal data. There aren't too many huge announcements about A.I. investments, but perhaps this is a strategy given the sensitivity of the data. </p> \n <p>Don't forget that Facebook also owns Oculus Rift, the VR company. </p> \n <p>Mark Zuckerberg is having a tough time explaining himself and the practices of the company to Congress. He says, A.I. will have to help solve the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17202886/facebook-fake-news-moderation-ai-challenges\">fake news problem. </a></p> \n <p>IBM (IBM)</p> \n <p>IBM has put a lot of effort into developing IBM Watson. In Q3 2017 it announced another $240 million investment in this business A.I. platform. If this works out, IBM will provide businesses with a suite of A.I. solutions, not relying on solely one product or service.</p> \n <p>The strategic imperatives business of IBM now <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/30/ibm-watson-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.aspx\">makes up 43% of total revenue</a> or $34 billion.</p> \n <p>IBM is came out with Q1 earnings on April 17th and has dropped 6% after-market. </p> \n <p>If you want to find the action abroad, there are other options out there.</p> \n <p>Baidu (BIDU)</p> \n <p>Something all Chinese companies have in common, is a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-baidu-artificial-intelligence/\">good environment to set up far-reaching experiments</a>. The Chinese government has a lot to say in the economy (this is an understatement), and it has decided to implement some ideas which would never pass Western standarts. I'm not making a value judgment here, but it's just a fact that societies in the West would not agree with these implementations. </p> \n <p>China has recently announced a plan to become the leader in A.I. in 2030. It has over 700 million internet users, many of which are using the all-incompassing app WeChat (which is a product of Tencent by the way). </p> \n <p>Even though Baidu announced they can mimic a voice after one minute of recording, many are not convinced it will be the next leader in the A.I. space. Of course, the company has a similar profile to other search engines such as Google and Yandex. It also offers videos, which it uses to do a lot of AI research on. </p> \n <p>Baidu only started a separate A.I. division last year. </p> \n <p>Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)</p> \n <p>Perhaps a better pick in the booming Chinese market is Tencent. WeChat has a huge amount of data on Chinese citizens. Worldwide the app has <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/03/05/wechat-1-billion-users/\">over a billion users</a>.</p> \n <p>Tencent is focused on three distinct areas: Robotics, Medical A.I. and 'general A.I.'. It has recently opened a <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/article/tencent-embarks-ai-future-robotics-x-lab/\">new laboratory</a> to develop robotics solutions. Granted, the vice president has said 'robotics' means everything connecting the real world with the actual world, like glasses or headphones for example. </p> \n <p>Alibaba (BABA)</p> \n <p>Alibaba has been investing in A.I. for a while now and recently it made headlines. It participated in another investment round for SenseTime, now 'the most valuable A.I. start-up in the world' according to some, valued at approximately $3 billion.</p> \n <p>The company has software that's <a href=\"https://qz.com/1248493/sensetime-the-billion-dollar-alibaba-backed-ai-company-thats-quietly-watching-everyone-in-china/\">tracking faces of millions of Chinese citizens</a> on a daily basis. Believe it or not, a study estimated that China would have <a href=\"https://technode.com/2017/11/22/china-to-have-626-million-surveillance-cameras-within-3-years/\">626 million surveillance</a> cameras running by 2020. Analysts believe SenseTime has government agencies as major clients, which is of course a good thing. Here we see, again, that the stance of the Chinese government, opening up huge data sets, is helping the company to develop its technology. This would not be possible in many other countries.</p> \n <p>Yandex (YNDX)</p> \n <p>Yandex is similar to Google or Baidu. In essence, it's a search engine that has developed new products and services around its main business. Yandex is focused on developing more efficient processes for industrial players. A good bet, as it's well known that Russia could do better in this regard. While international sanctions might hurt the Russian economy, it could very well stimulate further efficiency improvements driving by domestic firms. Needless to say, anything sensitive to national security will not easily be 'outsourced' by the Russians.</p> \n <p>Another reason to include Yandex in this list is the drop from the highs. The stock is currently trading around $34 while it used to trade at $41 in February. </p> \n <p>If you don't want to own these data-driven A.I. plays directly, consider chipmakers like Nvidia, Intel and Micron.</p> \n <p>I'm not going to go in detail on these companies, but they are often named as a play on Artificial Intelligence. All of them are chip producers. The logic is that, as Artificial Intelligence grows, the demand for advanced chips will follow. Please do your own due diligence, because these companies are influenced by a lot of different trends in the industry. For some, the cryptocurrency craze has momentarily inflated their sales and valuations.</p> \n <p>As you can see, all three companies have decent to good earnings growth and operating margins. </p> \n <span> \n  <table>  \n   <tr> \n    <td> </td> \n    <td>Forward P/E</td> \n    <td>EPS growth last 5Y</td> \n    <td>Operating Margin</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>NVDA</td> \n    <td>31.2</td> \n    <td>38.6%</td> \n    <td>31.4%</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>INTC</td> \n    <td>13.42</td> \n    <td>7.8%</td> \n    <td>27.5%</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>MU</td> \n    <td>5.12</td> \n    <td>44.2%</td> \n    <td>41.8%</td> \n   </tr>  \n  </table></span> \n <p>Source: Made by the author using Finviz</p> \n <p>Over the last few months, all these companies have easily beaten the S&amp;P500 index.

We'll discuss an opportunity to dip your toes into the warming waters of a new entertainment technology company, growing like a weed. Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda. How many times have we said this to ourselves? In the context of our investing, I'm guessing we could all admit to several of those missed opportunities. Who wouldn't be happy to have thrown caution to the wind and invested a few bucks in the IPOs of what turned into some of today's most successful businesses? I'm referring to names like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Even a small investment had the potential of making us millionaires, several times over. Today, there exists a very small company, with a market cap of just $128 million. Though speculative today, like those mentioned above, it has the potential to blossom into a very successful investment as well. Not too long ago, a data and analytics company called Helios and Matheson Analytics, Inc. (HMNY) bought a controlling stake in MoviePass. Source: MoviePass The company describes itself as America's #1 movie subscription service. Here's how it works: Source: MoviePass site Sound familiar? Netflix charges a monthly subscription fee to watch as many movies as you like in your home or on the go. MoviePass, on the other hand, also charges a very reasonable monthly fee to watch movies. Only in this case, it is to watch one movie per day, on the big screen, at almost every movie theater in the country. In a recent article, I sang the praises of Peter Lynch, a highly revered investor who led the Magellan Fund to eye-popping gains for over 18 years. It was his principle of \"buy what you know\" that led me to the purchase of Roku, Inc. (ROKU) recently, discussed in depth in \"Retirement Security: What's This Growth Stock Doing In A Retirement Portfolio?\". Because we are running the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio and our subscriber portfolio primarily as a dividend growth vehicle, we purchased a small position in Roku and have done the same with our recent purchase of Helios and Matheson. Both are small-cap stocks, and neither pays a dividend, but both offer the possibility of outsize capital appreciation if management handles growth properly and everything falls into place. Majority owned by HMNY, MoviePass is currently the fastest growing subscription service in the U.S. The company's subscription base has grown rapidly over the past six months to 2 million, and the CEO believes, at the rapid pace of new sign-ups they've been experiencing, that subscribers will reach the 5 million mark by the end of this year. HMNY's market cap is currently $128 million. Should subs reach the projected level, MoviePass revenues from subscriptions alone will reach approximately $600 million. The average movie ticket across the country costs about $8.00. The consumer who becomes a subscriber pays $9.95 per month. After seeing their first movie of the month, they are almost even. After seeing the second movie, they're already ahead, having saved $6.05. See thirty movies per month, and you'll save $230.00 per month. MoviePass pays the theater full price for your ticket. So, if the average moviegoer attends one movie per week, the cost to the company is $32.00. Since they have only collected $9.95 from you, they would appear to be in the hole by about $22 per month. If you ran a lemonade stand like this when you were a kid, your folks might encourage you to close up shop as soon as your first pitcher was consumed. After all, how can you give away the store like this and stay in business? As MoviePass's growth has picked up steam, they have begun to negotiate revenue sharing arrangements with film distributors and movie theaters. In the movie business, there are already revenue-splitting arrangements between the film studios, the distributors and the exhibitors (movie theaters). MoviePass has already begun to succeed in negotiations to share 25% of ticket sales, and 25% of concessions sales. That popcorn, soda, and candy you buy at the concession stand represent 25% of the revenues generated at theaters today. These revenue-sharing agreements are just the beginning for MoviePass. They believe that as subscriptions grow by the millions they will gain far greater leverage to negotiate higher shares for themselves. Everything will grow as it scales its business relationships. Helios and Matheson, at bottom, is a data analytics firm. Their purchase of MoviePass was conceived as a method to gain valuable consumer data that can be monetized. And, they're already succeeding in this sphere. Using the location and time data that comes through the use of the MoviePass app, they are gathering valuable information that they sell to the movie theaters. This data feeds the theaters information telling them what time of day moviegoers are coming to their theaters, what day of the week, how many are coming, how many are choosing specific movies, and how often these consumers are using the services. This information can be used by the theaters to determine if they need to open more theaters per movie if a big hit is forming, when to schedule their movies, how to most effectively market particular movies, etc. Helios is also making money on advertising. They partner with movie makers and theater owners to advertise chosen movies by sending emails to MoviePass subscribers, recommending these particular movies. Their research has already revealed that this approach drives traffic to the theaters that would otherwise not have gone. This is a boon to theater revenue that didn't exist before. In a recent research study, Helios asked MoviePass subscribers if they would have attended the movies on a recent holiday weekend had they not been subscribers and had to pay for the movies out of pocket. The answer was a resounding \"no\". In other words, because the movies were \"free\", they went out to the movies and the service drove large amounts of revenues to theaters which they otherwise would not have earned. Helios announced last Thursday it acquired Moviefone from Oath, Verizon Communication Inc.'s (VZ) digital unit for about $8.6 million. The complete transaction involves $1 million in cash, about 2.6 million shares, and warrants for 2.6 million additional shares priced at $5.50; the stake has a one-year lock-up period, meaning there will be no imminent selling of shares to put downward pressure on the price. Even so, the share price would have to almost double from here to make selling those shares a profitable proposition. The Moviefone website, which aggregates information on new film and TV content, is seen as a complement to Helios and Matheson's majority-owned MoviePass. Source: Moviefone Moviefone's website offers moviegoers trailers on all the latest movies and DVD's, information about the cast and crew, a synopsis on each movie and click through to buy tickets at your local movie house and even choose your seat. MoviePass's purchase of Moviefone is another strategy to cross-sell MoviePass subscriptions to Moviefone's 7 million subscribers. It is also another way for HMNY to earn advertising dollars and revenue share on tickets sold, DVD's purchased, as well as advertising on the site itself (notice the ad for GiGi on the upper right of that screenshot above). Not to mention all of the data HMNY will aggregate from all of the Moviefone customer's movie choices, ticket sale, etc. Canaccord Genuity analyst Austin Moldow said, There is minimal overlap between MoviePass's user base and Moviefone's. Adding Moviefone to the stable will expand MoviePass's ability to market to a wider base. Moldow said, Moviefone is the largest brand of movie entertainment sites. Although it historically reported solid 20 percent year-over-year traffic growth in 2016, last year saw a decline. The site averaged 7.2 million monthly views in 2016, but that number fell in 2017. Canaccord believes, On April 6th, MoviePass announced a partnership with Flix Brewhouse, the nation's only cinema circuit that pairs full service in-theater dining with an award-winning craft brewery at every location. Started in 2011, Flix Brewhouse is based in Round Rock, Texas and operates locations there as well as in Iowa, Indiana, New Mexico, and the DFW metroplex, which is expected to open in April 2018. As of the time of the announcement of the partnership, MoviePass was fully integrated into the point of sale ticketing systems at all Flix Brewhouse theaters. MoviePass members can now use the service at Flix Brewhouses for additional benefits and features, including e-ticketing, in-app reserved seat selection, advance screening booking. The announcement comes as MoviePass continues to expand its exhibitor presence by focusing on partnering with exciting and innovative exhibitors around the country. In reaction to this new partnership, Bernadette McCabe, Senior Vice President of Exhibitor Relations & Business Strategy at MoviePass said, Flix CEO Allan Reagan had this to say: As discussed earlier, MoviePass currently boasts over two million members nationwide. With additional Flix theaters opening in Madison, Wisconsin and suburban Phoenix later this year, Flix Brewhouse expects total 2018 attendance of approximately 2 million, including MoviePass members. Flix recently announced a $26M equity investment, which it expects will fuel growth to 11 locations and 95 screens by the end of 2019, with a robust pipeline beyond. Revenues and Earnings Both revenues and earnings have exhibited steady declines for the last three years. It is assumed that, with rapid growth of subs from MoviePass and those brought onboard via Moviefone, both of these metrics will begin to show improvement in the not too distant future. The company last paid dividends of $.08 per share in 2014. There is always the possibility that dividends may be resumed if earnings going forward allow for it. Along with decreasing total revenue, the cost of that revenue has also been decreasing, in concert with gross profit, except for a blip upwards in 2015. Financials courtesy of Nasdaq Net income has decreased from $383,000 in 2013 to a loss of $7,381,000 in 2016. Admittedly, this is a speculative investment in a company that has been struggling the last few years. However, HMNY is making very aggressive moves, buying large majority interests in movie entertainment companies with which it can exercise its expertise, aggregating data and selling that valuable information to companies that demand it. In a way, it is creating its own market for a product in demand. The 52-week range for this stock has been $2.20 on the low and $38.86 on the high. We began a very small opening position of 1,000 shares at $3.04 in the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio. We believe that in coming months, the company will begin to report robust growth in revenues coming from all of the sources we've discussed. Once the company reaches scale, like Netflix, it will begin to exercise greater degrees of leverage with its many partners and wring out a larger revenue stream which will go to the bottom line as profit eventually. Helios wants MoviePass to be the vehicle that turns around movie theater revenue which has been falling for several years with all of the at-home competition coming from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and others. It seeks to re-energize the movie-going experience and bring consumers out again, to enjoy an evening outside of the home on the big screen. If MoviePass is successful in disrupting the digital disrupters, it has a shot at becoming the Netflix of the out-of-home, big-screen experience. Before sharing this research with readers, I did a few months of on-the-ground research of my own. The sign-up experience had only one drawback. It took the company about 2 weeks to send the credit-card-like pass in the mail that the user swipes at the theater ticket counter or kiosk to obtain his ticket. The monthly charge, however, does not begin till the user sees their first movie. Once received, we quickly learned that the experience was seamless and easy. The user opens the free app on their phone or tablet and chooses either a movie they're interested in seeing, or a list of theaters nearby (the app reads your location via location services on your device). The user then goes to their theater of choice, chooses the movie they wish to see on the app, and checks in by clicking \"check in\". Finally, they present their MoviePass card at the ticket counter to obtain the ticket. Some theaters accept an e-ticket that pops up on the phone after the check-in. *caveat - you must have an internet connection within 150 feet of the theater in order to use the app. Most users have mobile phones with data connections, so this is never a problem. It's a really simple app to use and a great way for movie buffs to see a great deal of movies for just $9.95 per month. We've seen about 10 so far! See you at the movies! Aside from two technology/entertainment companies recently purchased, the FTG Portfolio contains a good helping of dividend growth stocks, as does our subscriber portfolio. It was built with the express purpose of benefiting from this defensive strategy and volatile, extreme stock market environments that have become the norm since February 26 of this year. Three years ago, on Dec. 24, 2014, I began writing a series of articles to demonstrate the real-life construction and management of a portfolio dedicated to growing income to close a yawning gap that so many millions of seniors and near-retirees face today between their Social Security benefit and retirement expenses. The beginning article was titled \"This Is Not Your Father's Retirement Plan.\" This project began with $411,600 in capital that was deployed in such a way that each of the portfolio constituents yielded approximately equal amounts of yearly income. Continuing the see-saw we've all been on since the February correction began, on Tuesday, the market was given a gift by China's president, Xi. At an Asian summit meeting, he made a speech that appeared to offer concessions to Mr. Trump in his quest for fairness in international trade. Xi offered to further open up the Chinese economy to foreign investment, make it easier for international companies to do business, and offered to reduce the tariffs on cars and other products he had recently threatened to impose in retaliation to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In response, the market celebrated, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) up 429 points, or 1.79%. The S&P 500 Index (SPY) had a similar gain on the day. Dividend growth investors continue to inhabit a happy place, insulated from the daily anxieties and fears that constantly weigh on price-focused investors. This holds true, especially during extreme volatility that we are experiencing. Gone are the days, it seems, when the Dow rose or fell some 20 or so points. If a move is fewer than 200 points in either direction, it doesn't even feel normal any longer with the \"new normal\" in volatility that we are living with. I continue to encourage readers to look at the following table whenever their stock market nerve is being tested by this ongoing volatility. We have enjoyed nine very recent dividend raises in the FTG Portfolio. Source: Author From tariff wars to tariff concessions, we seem to be moving in a more conciliatory manner (at least from the Chinese side). Dividend growth stocks, along with U.S. Treasuries, are some of the places where investors can find consistency and solace. Calm and stability can be purchased for a price. Since the correction began, that price has decreased considerably and given income investors an opportunity to grow their income at higher yields and lower prices. While we gain the stability we seek from our dividends, we think it is appropriate, on occasion, to branch out with small investments in pure growth stocks that present great potential for capital gains in the future. Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were pure growth stocks when they IPO'd. Neither paid dividends for many years. Today, with years of growth and maturity under their belts, Microsoft pays a dividend with a 1.82% yield, just below the S&P 500 yield of about 2%, while Apple shares carry a 1.46% dividend yield. Both Roku and Helios may also join the parade of dividend growth stocks, down the road. As always, I look forward to your comments, discussion and questions. Did you find comfort in Tuesday's price recovery? Or, have you begun to look at these recoveries as an occasion to lighten up and take profits? Are you still buying the dips which seem to occur every other day? Please let me know in the comment section how you approach these situations in your own portfolio and how you arrive at your decisions.

How many times have we said this to ourselves? In the context of our investing, I'm guessing we could all admit to several of those missed opportunities.</p> \n <p>Who wouldn't be happy to have thrown caution to the wind and invested a few bucks in the IPOs of what turned into some of today's most successful businesses? I'm referring to names like Facebook (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FB\">FB</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>), Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\">NFLX</a>) and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\">GOOGL</a>). Even a small investment had the potential of making us millionaires, several times over.</p> \n <p>Today, there exists a very small company, with a market cap of just $128 million. Though speculative today, like those mentioned above, it has the potential to blossom into a very successful investment as well.</p> \n <p>Not too long ago, a data and analytics company called Helios and Matheson Analytics, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMNY\">HMNY</a>) bought a controlling stake in MoviePass.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.moviepass.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Branded&amp;utm_term=Branded%20Terms&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwbHWBRBWEiwAMIV7E7cZ_IrS8JAaHw9KM63vmmEl26ypXgZIhtSNK_CHRWeY1V4_NBjSxxoCcSoQAvD_BwE\">MoviePass</a></p> \n <p>The company describes itself as America's #1 movie subscription service.</p> \n <p>Here's how it works:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Source: MoviePass site</p> \n <p>Sound familiar? Netflix charges a monthly subscription fee to watch as many movies as you like in your home or on the go.</p> \n <p>MoviePass, on the other hand, also charges a very reasonable monthly fee to watch movies. Only in this case, it is to watch one movie per day, on the big screen, at almost every movie theater in the country.</p> \n <p>In a recent article, I sang the praises of Peter Lynch, a highly revered investor who led the Magellan Fund to eye-popping gains for over 18 years. It was his principle of \"buy what you know\" that led me to the purchase of Roku, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU\">ROKU</a>) recently, discussed in depth in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4156113-retirement-security-growth-stock-retirement-portfolio\">\"Retirement Security: What's This Growth Stock Doing In A Retirement Portfolio?\"</a>.</p> \n <p>Because we are running the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio and our subscriber portfolio primarily as a dividend growth vehicle, we purchased a small position in Roku and have done the same with our recent purchase of Helios and Matheson. Both are small-cap stocks, and neither pays a dividend, but both offer the possibility of outsize capital appreciation if management handles growth properly and everything falls into place.</p> \n <p>Majority owned by HMNY, MoviePass is currently the fastest growing subscription service in the U.S. The company's subscription base has grown rapidly over the past six months to 2 million, and the CEO believes, at the rapid pace of new sign-ups they've been experiencing, that subscribers will reach the 5 million mark by the end of this year.</p> \n <p>HMNY's market cap is currently $128 million. Should subs reach the projected level, MoviePass revenues from subscriptions alone will reach approximately $600 million.</p> \n <p>The average movie ticket across the country costs about $8.00. The consumer who becomes a subscriber pays $9.95 per month. After seeing their first movie of the month, they are almost even. After seeing the second movie, they're already ahead, having saved $6.05. See thirty movies per month, and you'll save $230.00 per month.</p> \n <p>MoviePass pays the theater full price for your ticket. So, if the average moviegoer attends one movie per week, the cost to the company is $32.00. Since they have only collected $9.95 from you, they would appear to be in the hole by about $22 per month.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>If you ran a lemonade stand like this when you were a kid, your folks might encourage you to close up shop as soon as your first pitcher was consumed. After all, how can you give away the store like this and stay in business?</p> \n <p>As MoviePass's growth <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-moviepass-makes-or-doesnt-make-money/?partner=YahooSA&amp;yptr=yahoo\">has picked up steam</a>, they have begun to negotiate revenue sharing arrangements with film distributors and movie theaters. In the movie business, there are already revenue-splitting arrangements between the film studios, the distributors and the exhibitors (movie theaters).</p> \n <p>MoviePass has already begun to succeed in negotiations to share 25% of ticket sales, and 25% of concessions sales. That popcorn, soda, and candy you buy at the concession stand represent <a href=\"http://www.seancast.com/business/movies-theaters-money-myth/\">25% of the revenues</a> generated at theaters today. These revenue-sharing agreements are just the beginning for MoviePass. They believe that as subscriptions grow by the millions they will gain far greater leverage to negotiate higher shares for themselves. Everything will grow as it scales its business relationships.</p> \n <p>Helios and Matheson, at bottom, is a data analytics firm. Their purchase of MoviePass was conceived as a method to gain valuable consumer data that can be monetized. And, they're already succeeding in this sphere.</p> \n <p>Using the location and time data that comes through the use of the MoviePass app, they are gathering valuable information that they sell to the movie theaters. This data feeds the theaters information telling them what time of day moviegoers are coming to their theaters, what day of the week, how many are coming, how many are choosing specific movies, and how often these consumers are using the services. This information can be used by the theaters to determine if they need to open more theaters per movie if a big hit is forming, when to schedule their movies, how to most effectively market particular movies, etc.</p> \n <p>Helios is also making money on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-moviepass-makes-or-doesnt-make-money/?partner=YahooSA&amp;yptr=yahoo\">advertising</a>. They partner with movie makers and theater owners to advertise chosen movies by sending emails to MoviePass subscribers, recommending these particular movies. Their research has already revealed that this approach drives traffic to the theaters that would otherwise not have gone. This is a boon to theater revenue that didn't exist before.</p> \n <p>In a recent research study, Helios asked MoviePass subscribers if they would have attended the movies on a recent holiday weekend had they not been subscribers and had to pay for the movies out of pocket. The answer was a resounding \"no\". In other words, because the movies were \"free\", they went out to the movies and the service drove large amounts of revenues to theaters which they otherwise would not have earned.</p> \n <p>Helios announced last Thursday it acquired Moviefone from Oath, Verizon Communication Inc.'s (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VZ\">VZ</a>) digital unit for about $8.6 million.</p> \n <p>The complete transaction involves $1 million in cash, about 2.6 million shares, and warrants for 2.6 million additional shares priced at $5.50; the stake has a one-year lock-up period, meaning there will be no imminent selling of shares to put downward pressure on the price. Even so, the share price would have to almost double from here to make selling those shares a profitable proposition.</p> \n <p>The Moviefone website, which aggregates information on new film and TV content, is seen as a complement to Helios and Matheson's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/02/11217238/helios-and-matheson-increases-stake-in-moviepass-to-78?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\">majority-owned</a> MoviePass.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Source: Moviefone</p> \n <p>Moviefone's website offers moviegoers trailers on all the latest movies and DVD's, information about the cast and crew, a synopsis on each movie and click through to buy tickets at your local movie house and even choose your seat.</p> \n <p>MoviePass's purchase of Moviefone is another strategy to cross-sell MoviePass subscriptions to Moviefone's 7 million subscribers. It is also another way for HMNY to earn advertising dollars and revenue share on tickets sold, DVD's purchased, as well as advertising on the site itself (notice the ad for GiGi on the upper right of that screenshot above). Not to mention all of the data HMNY will aggregate from all of the Moviefone customer's movie choices, ticket sale, etc.</p> \n <p>Canaccord Genuity analyst Austin Moldow said,</p> \n <p>There is minimal overlap between MoviePass's user base and Moviefone's. Adding Moviefone to the stable will expand MoviePass's ability to market to a wider base.</p> \n <p>Moldow said,</p> \n <p>Moviefone is the largest brand of movie entertainment sites. Although it historically reported solid 20 percent year-over-year traffic growth in 2016, last year saw a decline.</p> \n <p>The site averaged 7.2 million monthly views in 2016, but that number fell in 2017.</p> \n <p>Canaccord believes,</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>On April 6th, MoviePass <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moviepass-flix-brewhouse-announce-official-154805056.html\">announced a partnership</a> with Flix Brewhouse, the nation's only cinema circuit that pairs full service in-theater dining with an award-winning craft brewery at every location. Started in 2011, Flix Brewhouse is based in Round Rock, Texas and operates locations there as well as in Iowa, Indiana, New Mexico, and the DFW metroplex, which is expected to open in April 2018.</p> \n <p>As of the time of the announcement of the partnership, MoviePass was fully integrated into the point of sale ticketing systems at all Flix Brewhouse theaters. MoviePass members can now use the service at Flix Brewhouses for additional benefits and features, including e-ticketing, in-app reserved seat selection, advance screening booking. The announcement comes as MoviePass continues to expand its exhibitor presence by focusing on partnering with exciting and innovative exhibitors around the country.</p> \n <p>In reaction to this new partnership, Bernadette McCabe, Senior Vice President of Exhibitor Relations &amp; Business Strategy at MoviePass said,</p> \n <p>Flix CEO Allan Reagan had this to say:</p> \n <p>As discussed earlier, MoviePass currently boasts over two million members nationwide. With additional Flix theaters opening in Madison, Wisconsin and suburban Phoenix later this year, Flix Brewhouse expects total 2018 attendance of approximately 2 million, including MoviePass members. Flix <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4r9l6uitIeLCNEBIwIKXRGH-yMeT15sjC3mjVxPos-m7ywPAURBzkqWO3pQsplpVZdtjBGsGhT45Hs0rJkRilni3WIwng4EtrKsuszz88K5Q3poH1Te87Si1TYD9zuW6mUAVEonE5fnmTASuOM-zOwZtxOnBmEjTjAT53rXD-LI=\">recently announced a $26M equity investment</a>, which it expects will fuel growth to 11 locations and 95 screens by the end of 2019, with a robust pipeline beyond.</p> \n <p>Revenues and Earnings</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Both revenues and earnings have exhibited steady declines for the last three years. It is assumed that, with rapid growth of subs from MoviePass and those brought onboard via Moviefone, both of these metrics will begin to show improvement in the not too distant future.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The company last paid dividends of $.08 per share in 2014. There is always the possibility that dividends may be resumed if earnings going forward allow for it.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Along with decreasing total revenue, the cost of that revenue has also been decreasing, in concert with gross profit, except for a blip upwards in 2015.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Financials courtesy of Nasdaq</p> \n <p>Net income has decreased from $383,000 in 2013 to a loss of $7,381,000 in 2016.</p> \n <p>Admittedly, this is a speculative investment in a company that has been struggling the last few years. However, HMNY is making very aggressive moves, buying large majority interests in movie entertainment companies with which it can exercise its expertise, aggregating data and selling that valuable information to companies that demand it. In a way, it is creating its own market for a product in demand.</p> \n <p>The 52-week range for this stock has been $2.20 on the low and $38.86 on the high. We began a very small opening position of 1,000 shares at $3.04 in the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio. We believe that in coming months, the company will begin to report robust growth in revenues coming from all of the sources we've discussed. Once the company reaches scale, like Netflix, it will begin to exercise greater degrees of leverage with its many partners and wring out a larger revenue stream which will go to the bottom line as profit eventually.</p> \n <p>Helios wants MoviePass to be the vehicle that turns around movie theater revenue which has been falling for several years with all of the at-home competition coming from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and others. It seeks to re-energize the movie-going experience and bring consumers out again, to enjoy an evening outside of the home on the big screen. If MoviePass is successful in disrupting the digital disrupters, it has a shot at becoming the Netflix of the out-of-home, big-screen experience.</p> \n <p>Before sharing this research with readers, I did a few months of on-the-ground research of my own. The sign-up experience had only one drawback. It took the company about 2 weeks to send the credit-card-like pass in the mail that the user swipes at the theater ticket counter or kiosk to obtain his ticket. The monthly charge, however, does not begin till the user sees their first movie.</p> \n <p>Once received, we quickly learned that the experience was seamless and easy. The user opens the free app on their phone or tablet and chooses either a movie they're interested in seeing, or a list of theaters nearby (the app reads your location via location services on your device).</p> \n <p>The user then goes to their theater of choice, chooses the movie they wish to see on the app, and checks in by clicking \"check in\". Finally, they present their MoviePass card at the ticket counter to obtain the ticket. Some theaters accept an e-ticket that pops up on the phone after the check-in.</p> \n <p>*caveat - you must have an internet connection within 150 feet of the theater in order to use the app. Most users have mobile phones with data connections, so this is never a problem.</p> \n <p>It's a really simple app to use and a great way for movie buffs to see a great deal of movies for just $9.95 per month. We've seen about 10 so far!</p> \n <p>See you at the movies!</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Aside from two technology/entertainment companies recently purchased, the FTG Portfolio contains a good helping of dividend growth stocks, as does our subscriber portfolio. It was built with the express purpose of benefiting from this defensive strategy and volatile, extreme stock market environments that have become the norm since February 26 of this year.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Three years ago, on Dec. 24, 2014, I began writing a series of articles to demonstrate the real-life construction and management of a portfolio dedicated to growing income to close a yawning gap that so many millions of seniors and near-retirees face today between their Social Security benefit and retirement expenses.</p> \n <p>The beginning article was titled \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2779635-retirees-this-is-not-your-fathers-retirement-plan-constructing-the-2015-fill-the-gap-portfolio\">This Is Not Your Father's Retirement Plan</a>.\" This project began with $411,600 in capital that was deployed in such a way that each of the portfolio constituents yielded approximately equal amounts of yearly income.</p> \n <p>Continuing the see-saw we've all been on since the February correction began, on Tuesday, the market was given a gift by China's president, Xi. At an Asian summit meeting, he made a speech that appeared to offer concessions to Mr. Trump in his quest for fairness in international trade. Xi offered to further open up the Chinese economy to foreign investment, make it easier for international companies to do business, and offered to reduce the tariffs on cars and other products he had recently threatened to impose in retaliation to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In response, the market celebrated, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIA\">DIA</a>) up 429 points, or 1.79%. The S&amp;P 500 Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a>) had a similar gain on the day.</p> \n <p>Dividend growth investors continue to inhabit a happy place, insulated from the daily anxieties and fears that constantly weigh on price-focused investors. This holds true, especially during extreme volatility that we are experiencing. Gone are the days, it seems, when the Dow rose or fell some 20 or so points. If a move is fewer than 200 points in either direction, it doesn't even feel normal any longer with the \"new normal\" in volatility that we are living with.</p> \n <p>I continue to encourage readers to look at the following table whenever their stock market nerve is being tested by this ongoing volatility. We have enjoyed nine very recent dividend raises in the FTG Portfolio.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Source: Author</p> \n <p>From tariff wars to tariff concessions, we seem to be moving in a more conciliatory manner (at least from the Chinese side).</p> \n <p>Dividend growth stocks, along with U.S. Treasuries, are some of the places where investors can find consistency and solace. Calm and stability can be purchased for a price. Since the correction began, that price has decreased considerably and given income investors an opportunity to grow their income at higher yields and lower prices.</p> \n <p>While we gain the stability we seek from our dividends, we think it is appropriate, on occasion, to branch out with small investments in pure growth stocks that present great potential for capital gains in the future.</p> \n <p>Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) were pure growth stocks when they IPO'd.

There are growth areas for Oracle to address. The current price level provides a decent risk-reward ratio. The company seems to be undervalued at the moment. The price movement of Oracle's (ORCL) stock has not been positive over the last month. Hence, ORCL has dropped about 15% over just 15 trading days, reflecting a more than $30 billion decrease in market capitalization. Such drops are not usual for long-established corporations with a $200 billion valuation and, apparently, some investors are worried about the dynamics of the stock. (Source: Finviz.com) The drop was catalyzed by the latest quarterly results reported on March 19. Even though the company beat on EPS by $0.11, Oracle's revenue appeared to be in line with the expectations, which was likely to be not enough for investors. Moreover, modest Q4 guidance brought some disappointment regarding the expected revenue growth: \"Q4 guidance has revenue growing 1% to 3% on last year's $10.94B compared to the $11.22B consensus.\" The management also guided cloud-related revenues to be lower than expected. (Source: Finviz.com) As a result of this, analysts started to raise their concerns over the future of the company. For instance, Credit Suisse analyst Brian Zelnick stated the results \"underwhelmed on most relevant metrics and fiscal Q4 guidance was similarly disappointing,\" which is why he lowered his price target for the stock. Interestingly, he maintained an outperform rating on ORCL, and his lowered price target is $60, which is 32% higher than the current price. Total cloud revenues went up from $3,211 million in FY 2017 to $4,552 million in FY 2018 on a nine-month basis. This is a 42% increase year-over-year, which is a substantial jump for any corporation, and while it is wise to take a conservative approach for analyzing the performance, I do not see any strong reason for being concerned about Oracle's cloud business at the moment. Hence, such segments as Fusion Cloud and Cloud PaaS and IaaS (excluding legacy posting services) saw impressive growth of 52% and 56% in U.S. dollars, respectively. Therefore, I believe it is too early to say that Oracle is \"having trouble keeping up.\" Moreover, while the guidance for Q4 is indeed lower than expected, the difference is not significant and can be explained by the seasonality or other factors. It is clear that one quarter is not an adequate sample that one can base decisions on. Additionally, Oracle has been good at beating expectations over the last four quarters, and this is likely to continue in the future, as many areas can be addressed by Oracle's cloud and AI businesses. (Source: Seeking Alpha) For instance, digital marketing is still the area that Oracle can profit from. I analyzed the topic in one of my previous articles, stating that the acquisition strategy of the software giant suggests the company is moving in that direction. The deals included: The marketing solutions can enhance the company's cloud offering and boost cloud sales. Considering the market for digital marketing is expected to increase significantly over the coming years, the segment can become a viable source of growth for Oracle. (Source: Statista) Another point is blockchain. Oracle's Blockchain Cloud Services are included in the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) family of offerings, and while it is still a young solution (it was announced about five months ago), I believe it can gain significant traction in the future. Oracle has enough resources to make a commercially viable product in this area, which would increase the attractiveness of its cloud and software solutions. More information on the topic can be found in my previous article on ORCL here: Oracle Joins The Blockchain Party. Additionally, such areas as healthcare and ERP with AI on the cloud can boost the company's performance. Bruce Palsulich, VP of safety product strategy for Oracle Health Sciences, emphasizes AI and cloud can \"improve quality and accuracy in the handling of the data\" by pharmacovigilance teams, thus improving the quality of treatment. Healthcare is one of biggest industries in the world, and many tech corporations, like Apple (AAPL) or Amazon (AMZN), are trying to penetrate the market. Importantly, Deloitte projects the global spend on healthcare will reach $8.7 trillion by 2020, with \"smart\" health treatment being the primary trend and area of growth. I investigated the topic in more detail in this article: Healthcare Will Catalyze Apple's Growth. Overall, there are many promising areas of business that can be addressed by Oracle's cloud and software solutions, which is why the company's upside potential is solid. It is still too early to tell that the company \"hits a cloud speed bump,\" as a guidance for only one quarter does not provide enough information to draw any conclusions. A brief look at the valuation multiples indicates the company is likely to be undervalued versus peers. For instance, Oracle has the lowest forward P/E ratio among enterprise software and cloud companies, such as Salesforce (CRM), SAP (SAP), or Amazon. To strengthen the analysis, I use a discount cash flow model to value the company. I updated my model in light of Q3 FY 2018 results. 1. The average annual revenue growth rate over the horizon period of five years is estimated to be around 5.2%, with 6% increase in fiscal 2018, which complies with the management's guidance. The growth will be primarily driven by the cloud segment in multiple areas. 2. The average EBITDA margin will be around 43%, which is a conservative assumption, taking into consideration cloud business will enable margins to grow. This was emphasized during the latest earnings call: 3. I capitalize average gross PP&E growth of 10% for the next five years, adjusting the number according to management expectations. 4. The after-tax cost of debt is 3.2%. The cost of equity capital (12.8%) is computed using CAPM, with 1.15 beta, 2.4% risk-free rate, and 9% market premium. The WACC is therefore 10.6%. Here is the operating and balance sheet data used in the modeling: As a result, the model shows $226 billion equity value under the base scenario, which assumes EV/EBITDA multiple will be 11 by the end of the horizon period (fiscal 2022). In this case, the fair value of the stock is $55.4. Under the optimistic scenario (12x EBITDA terminal value), equity value is $240.4 billion or $58.9 per share, representing about 27% upside potential for the stock. The sensitivity analysis shows a range of possible outcomes that will be driven by actual results of the corporation. In light of this, the fair price range is $53.6-57.1. Importantly, Oracle also continues to reduce its number of shares outstanding, which can also act as another catalyst for a share price increase. Overall, the main investor takeaway is the fact that Oracle's prospects remain to be just fine. The growth in the cloud business is guided to be slightly lower than expected, but one quarter is not enough to draw any conclusions. There are many markets and segments that can easily boost the corporation's performance in the coming years, such as blockchain, healthcare AI, or ERP. Therefore, the upside potential seems to be decent, which is also supported by the fact that Oracle is undervalued versus peers. Moreover, the DCF analysis shows that the stock has room to grow, as the fair price range is about 20% higher than the current stock price. With regards to potential downside, the technical picture looks attractive. Thus, the stock faced a strong buying activity near the support level of $44, with an increase in volumes. I believe the range of $42-44 is the limit for a downward movement, while the growth target is between $54 and $57 at the moment. As a result, the risk-reward ratio is about 1:3, which makes Oracle attractive for investment. (Source: Finviz.com) Investors should, however, still be aware of general market risks, as the volatility in the market has increased over the last two months.

There are growth areas for Oracle to address.</p> \n <p> </p> \n <p>The current price level provides a decent risk-reward ratio. The company seems to be undervalued at the moment.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The price movement of Oracle's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\">ORCL</a>) stock has not been positive over the last month. Hence, ORCL has dropped about 15% over just 15 trading days, reflecting a more than $30 billion decrease in market capitalization. Such drops are not usual for long-established corporations with a $200 billion valuation and, apparently, some investors are worried about the dynamics of the stock.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>(Source: Finviz.com)</p> \n <p>The drop was catalyzed by the latest quarterly results <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157663-oracles-orcl-ceo-safra-catz-mark-hurd-q3-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">reported</a> on March 19. Even though the company beat on EPS by $0.11, Oracle's revenue appeared to be in line with the expectations, which was likely to be not enough for investors. Moreover, modest Q4 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3340374-oracle-q4-guidance-features-cloud-disappointment\">guidance</a> brought some disappointment regarding the expected revenue growth: \"Q4 guidance has revenue growing 1% to 3% on last year's $10.94B compared to the $11.22B consensus.\" The management also guided cloud-related revenues to be lower than expected.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>(Source: Finviz.com)</p> \n <p>As a result of this, analysts <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-pounded-as-business-outlook-falls-short-cloud-transition-slows/?src=A00220&amp;yptr=yahoo\">started</a> to raise their concerns over the future of the company. For instance, Credit Suisse analyst Brian Zelnick stated the results \"underwhelmed on most relevant metrics and fiscal Q4 guidance was similarly disappointing,\" which is why he lowered his price target for the stock. Interestingly, he maintained an outperform rating on ORCL, and his lowered price target is $60, which is 32% higher than the current price.</p> \n <p>Total cloud revenues <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/3946097\">went</a> up from $3,211 million in FY 2017 to $4,552 million in FY 2018 on a nine-month basis. This is a 42% increase year-over-year, which is a substantial jump for any corporation, and while it is wise to take a conservative approach for analyzing the performance, I do not see any strong reason for being concerned about Oracle's cloud business at the moment. Hence, such segments as Fusion Cloud and Cloud PaaS and IaaS (excluding legacy posting services) saw impressive growth of 52% and 56% in U.S. dollars, respectively. Therefore, I believe it is too early to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-hits-cloud-speed-bump-214500822.html\">say</a> that Oracle is \"having trouble keeping up.\"</p> \n <p>Moreover, while the guidance for Q4 is indeed lower than expected, the difference is not significant and can be explained by the seasonality or other factors. It is clear that one quarter is not an adequate sample that one can base decisions on. Additionally, Oracle has been good at beating expectations over the last four quarters, and this is likely to continue in the future, as many areas can be addressed by Oracle's cloud and AI businesses.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>(Source: Seeking Alpha)</p> \n <p>For instance, digital marketing is still the area that Oracle can profit from. I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4069102-oracle-tech-giant-set-soar\">analyzed</a> the topic in one of my previous articles, stating that the acquisition strategy of the software giant suggests the company is moving in that direction. The deals included:</p> \n <p>The marketing solutions can enhance the company's cloud offering and boost cloud sales. Considering the market for digital marketing is expected to increase significantly over the coming years, the segment can become a viable source of growth for Oracle.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>(Source: <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/\">Statista)</a></p> \n <p>Another point is blockchain. Oracle's Blockchain Cloud Services are included in the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) family of offerings, and while it is still a young solution (it was announced about five months ago), I believe it can gain significant traction in the future. Oracle has enough resources to make a commercially viable product in this area, which would increase the attractiveness of its cloud and software solutions. More information on the topic can be found in my previous article on ORCL here: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4115483-oracle-joins-blockchain-party\">Oracle Joins The Blockchain Party.</a></p> \n <p>Additionally, such areas as healthcare and ERP with AI on the cloud can boost the company's performance. Bruce Palsulich, VP of safety product strategy for Oracle Health Sciences, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-60-drug-safety-experts-120000823.html\">emphasizes</a> AI and cloud can \"improve quality and accuracy in the handling of the data\" by pharmacovigilance teams, thus improving the quality of treatment. Healthcare is one of biggest industries in the world, and many tech corporations, like Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) or Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>), are trying to penetrate the market. Importantly, Deloitte <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/global-health-care-sector-outlook.html\">projects</a> the global spend on healthcare will reach $8.7 trillion by 2020, with \"smart\" health treatment being the primary trend and area of growth. I investigated the topic in more detail in this article: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4155362-healthcare-will-catalyze-apples-growth\">Healthcare Will Catalyze Apple's Growth.</a></p> \n <p>Overall, there are many promising areas of business that can be addressed by Oracle's cloud and software solutions, which is why the company's upside potential is solid. It is still too early to tell that the company \"hits a cloud speed bump,\" as a guidance for only one quarter does not provide enough information to draw any conclusions.</p> \n <p>A brief look at the valuation multiples indicates the company is likely to be undervalued versus peers. For instance, Oracle has the lowest forward P/E ratio among enterprise software and cloud companies, such as Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\">CRM</a>), SAP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAP\">SAP</a>), or Amazon.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>To strengthen the analysis, I use a discount cash flow model to value the company. I updated my model in light of Q3 FY 2018 results.</p> \n <p>1. The average annual revenue growth rate over the horizon period of five years is estimated to be around 5.2%, with 6% increase in fiscal 2018, which complies with the management's guidance. The growth will be primarily driven by the cloud segment in multiple areas.</p> \n <p>2. The average EBITDA margin will be around 43%, which is a conservative assumption, taking into consideration cloud business will enable margins to grow. This was emphasized during the latest earnings call:</p> \n <p>3. I capitalize average gross PP&amp;E growth of 10% for the next five years, adjusting the number according to management expectations.</p> \n <p>4. The after-tax cost of debt is 3.2%. The cost of equity capital (12.8%) is computed using CAPM, with 1.15 beta, 2.4% risk-free rate, and 9% market premium. The WACC is therefore 10.6%.</p> \n <p>Here is the operating and balance sheet data used in the modeling:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>As a result, the model shows $226 billion equity value under the base scenario, which assumes EV/EBITDA multiple will be 11 by the end of the horizon period (fiscal 2022). In this case, the fair value of the stock is $55.4. Under the optimistic scenario (12x EBITDA terminal value), equity value is $240.4 billion or $58.9 per share, representing about 27% upside potential for the stock. The sensitivity analysis shows a range of possible outcomes that will be driven by actual results of the corporation. In light of this, the fair price range is $53.6-57.1.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Importantly, Oracle also continues to reduce its number of shares outstanding, which can also act as another catalyst for a share price increase.</p> \n <p>Overall, the main investor takeaway is the fact that Oracle's prospects remain to be just fine. The growth in the cloud business is guided to be slightly lower than expected, but one quarter is not enough to draw any conclusions. There are many markets and segments that can easily boost the corporation's performance in the coming years, such as blockchain, healthcare AI, or ERP.</p> \n <p>Therefore, the upside potential seems to be decent, which is also supported by the fact that Oracle is undervalued versus peers. Moreover, the DCF analysis shows that the stock has room to grow, as the fair price range is about 20% higher than the current stock price. With regards to potential downside, the technical picture looks attractive. Thus, the stock faced a strong buying activity near the support level of $44, with an increase in volumes.

The company's prospects for 5G and the NXP acquisition may be damaged, with no sign of an early settlement with Apple. As the acrid smell of cordite fades from the battlefield of the Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO) attempt to acquire Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), what remains for investors is to digest the implications of what transpired, and form a view of the future for Qualcomm. This author's view that the circumstances surrounding Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm had evolved to comprise too many variables of uncertain outcome to justify continuing to hold the stock was published on Seeking Alpha On February 5, 2018 in an article titled \"Qualcomm: A Tipping Point\". Among those potentially disruptive factors to which Qualcomm was subject were an enormous tax charge, large regulatory fines, a disappointing company forecast, customer resistance to a takeover of the company, and the rising cost of the NXP acquisition.This view has now been vindicated by subsequent events, with Qualcomm's stock exhibiting a downward trend since that time. Qualcomm's stock price has dropped 11.72% since January 22, 2018. In the end, Broadcom's hostile bid was defeated by a heady mix of politics, national security, and trade protectionism, a cocktail which developed in the final days of the bid. From before his election President Donald Trump propounded trade protectionism and a confrontational approach to trade with China. He implemented those views upon ascending to the presidency by appointing Peter Navarro, a polarizing protectionist on trade with China, to be director of trade and industrial policy as well as director of the White House national trade council. Where did politics play a direct role in determining the outcome of Broadcom's attempt to acquire Qualcomm? Qualcomm made much of Broadcom's ties to China, while ironically itself having extensive connections with that nation. Qualcomm has both joint ventures and partnerships in China. The company has also assisted Chinese enterprises, including Huawei, in penetrating international markets. Additionally, Qualcomm has been fined by the U.S. government for breaching the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. With Broadcom's relocation to the U.S. imminent, and as a growing number of institutional shareholders like T. Rowe Price Group Inc. submitted early votes for Broadcom's slate of directors, a desperate Qualcomm board, after outspending Broadcom on Washington lobbying by 100 to 1 at $8.3 million, filed a voluntary complaint with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. That committee would not normally consider a takeover transaction until a legal acquisition agreement had been entered into, but it chose to do so on this occasion. In just another few days, by which time Broadcom was scheduled to complete its relocation to the U.S., CFIUS would no longer have had jurisdiction over the transaction. Using the CFIUS complaint as an entree, shortly thereafter Trump issued an order citing national security and nixing the deal even before the committee's investigation was complete. As a strategic matter, Broadcom should clearly have effected their redomicile to the U.S. before launching a bid for Qualcomm. This would have negated national security objections and sidelined CFIUS. For investors then, the outcome is clearly a political determination and one which is not reflective of the economics or valuation of Qualcomm's business. Nonetheless the episode has brought into sharp focus dissatisfaction with Qualcomm management on the part of many of the stock's institutional shareholders. Together institutional investors own 78.71% of Qualcomm's outstanding stock as of the most recent 13F filings, and it became apparent over time that there was broad support among them for Broadcom's bid. The reasons for this dissatisfaction are quite distinct. Since FY 2014 Qualcomm's annual sales revenue has fallen by an average of 5% annually, from $26.49 billion in 2014 to $22.29 billion in 2017, as net income dropped from $7.54 billion to $2.47 billion in the same period. In that time, diluted EPS was down to $1.66 from $4.40. With portfolio managers having mark-to-market targets to meet, these numbers explain why there is a strong wish for management change being harbored by a majority of institutional holders of Qualcomm. The company is to hold its rescheduled annual shareholder meeting on March 23, and more institutional shareholder dissatisfaction with the board is expected to surface at that time. Despite these concerns many portfolio managers have stayed in the stock because of the market expansion promised by 5G, due in late 2018 after international wireless standards for the network were agreed in December. There was also hope of an early resolution of the legal dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL) over patent licensing fees, the issue producing customer withholding and regulatory fines which have been the main cause of Qualcomm's revenue decline. However the majority of institutional investors would have liked to have seen those landmarks achieved through a takeover by Broadcom, rather than at the hands of the existing Qualcomm board. An anomaly in that landscape is the pending acquisition by Qualcomm of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI). NXP, as the biggest supplier of processors to the car industry, promises desirable diversification for Qualcomm into markets other than smartphones, such as rapidly growing IoT and auto applications, at a time when the smartphone market is softening and sales of high-end phones are falling. In the waning days of Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm though, it became increasingly obvious that, as a result of the limitations on Broadcom's financing ability in the corporate bond market, Broadcom upon acquiring Qualcomm would seek to nullify the NXP deal or, if that were no longer legally feasible, spin off NXP at the earliest opportunity. Now that Qualcomm has the opportunity to complete the NXP acquisition unhindered, the deal should render improved financial fundamentals for Qualcomm. To use the same financial metrics as employed to describe Qualcomm earlier, in contrast NXP's annual sales revenue since FY 2014 has grown from $5.65 billion to $9.26 billion in 2017, an increase of nearly 64%. In that time net income has climbed from $539 million to $2.22 billion. Diluted EPS is up to $6.41 from $2.17 in 2014. In a twist of literary proportions though, Qualcomm, having complained to the U.S. government and the world in general regarding Broadcom's ties with China, and having gained the benefit of a political decision to terminate that company's bid on the grounds of national security with regard to China, now stands at the mercy of Chinese regulators concerning the necessary final approval to facilitate consummation of the $127.50 a share NXP transaction. Without Chinese approval, the NXP deal is unlikely to go through. It remains to be seen whether China through its Ministry of Commerce wishes to retaliate in political kind and administer a demarche to Qualcomm which would set the company back considerably. This concern is set in a wider context which itself does not favor a positive outcome for the NXP deal. Trump blocked the $1.3 billion bid of Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc.'s, a firm with Chinese ties, for Lattice Semiconductor Corp.(LSCC) in line with CFIUS recommendations. Also, in February the SEC nixed a proposed $20 billion purchase of the Chicago Stock Exchange by a group that included Chinese buyers. As to 5G, the value of the market for 5G infrastructure is projected to be $2.86 billion by the year 2020, reaching $33.72 Billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 50.9% from 2020 to 2026. These figures cover rising demand for mobile data services, network software implementation, growing machine-to-machine (M2M) industrial communication, and increasing demand for high speed and large network coverage. Qualcomm is looking to profit from 5G with its Snapdragon product line. Yet here again there is dramatic irony at play, as reflected in the following quote. -- Marina Koytcheva, VP Forecasting, CCS Insight If China, with the largest semiconductor market in the world, now seeks to be obstructive to Qualcomm's profiting from the innovation of 5G because of the demise of the Broadcom deal and other transactions to which it had connections, that fact will come to haunt Qualcomm and will then seriously reflect on the board's handling of the Broadcom bid. As regards resolution of the dispute with Apple, there are no indications at present that a settlement agreement is close at hand, leaving the prospect of a long and tortuous legal battle. Apple is seeking $1 billion from Qualcomm, and the related withholding by Apple and its contract manufacturers of patent license fees has already seriously depleted Qualcomm's annual revenue, with the apparent probability of this continuing to be the case for some time to come. Looking across all three major issues for Qualcomm going forward, namely the NXP acquisition, 5G launch, and the legal dispute with Apple, there are substantial concerns and uncertainties hanging over each. Added to these considerations is the fact that, as recently evidenced, a majority of Qualcomm's institutional holders are frustrated with the level of earnings and share price performance achieved by the current board over the past four years. For these reasons this author continues to advocate exiting Qualcomm to await more propitious times to hold the stock. Consider following this author.

Trump <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14521262/1/chinese-review-of-qualcomm-nxp-deal-in-spotlight-after-us-blocks-broadcom.html\">blocked</a> the $1.3 billion bid of Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc.'s, a firm with Chinese ties, for Lattice Semiconductor Corp.(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSCC\">LSCC</a>) in line with CFIUS recommendations. Also, in February the SEC nixed a proposed $20 billion purchase of the Chicago Stock Exchange by a group that included Chinese buyers. </p> \n <p>As to 5G, the value of the market for 5G infrastructure is <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/5g-technology.asp\">projected</a> to be $2.86 billion by the year 2020, reaching $33.72 Billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 50.9% from 2020 to 2026. These figures cover rising demand for mobile data services, network software implementation, growing machine-to-machine (M2M) industrial communication, and increasing demand for high speed and large network coverage. Qualcomm is looking to profit from 5G with its Snapdragon product line. Yet here again there is dramatic irony at play, as reflected in the following <a href=\"https://stocknews.com/news/qcom-qualcomm-inc-qcom-poised-to-benefit-from-5g-revolution/\">quote</a>.</p> \n <p>-- Marina Koytcheva, VP Forecasting, CCS Insight </p> \n <p>If China, with the largest semiconductor market in the world, now seeks to be obstructive to Qualcomm's profiting from the innovation of 5G because of the demise of the Broadcom deal and other transactions to which it had connections, that fact will come to haunt Qualcomm and will then seriously reflect on the board's handling of the Broadcom bid.</p> \n <p>As regards resolution of the dispute with Apple, there are no indications at present that a <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-legal-battle-end-apple/\">settlement</a> agreement is close at hand, leaving the prospect of a long and tortuous legal battle. Apple is seeking $1 billion from Qualcomm, and the related withholding by Apple and its contract manufacturers of patent license fees has already seriously depleted Qualcomm's annual revenue, with the apparent probability of this continuing to be the case for some time to come.</p> \n <p>Looking across all three major issues for Qualcomm going forward, namely the NXP acquisition, 5G launch, and the legal dispute with Apple, there are substantial concerns and uncertainties hanging over each. Added to these considerations is the fact that, as recently evidenced, a majority of Qualcomm's institutional holders are frustrated with the level of earnings and share price performance achieved by the current board over the past four years. For these reasons this author continues to advocate exiting Qualcomm to await more propitious times to hold the stock.</p> \n <p>Consider following this author.

At least one research house puts the iPhone's dollar value of market share above 50% in Q4. I believe that what may put iPhone into a strong first place globally over Android resides in Apple's dominance in wearables. After all, the smartphone wars may be more about the ecosystem now rather than Samsung and Android's unimaginative battle of the specs. At a large discount to the market, this bullish scenario is absent from AAPL's valuation. Background The thesis of this article is that AAPL may already be executing a plan that may, surprisingly, put Android into second place amongst operating systems globally. If so, there would be immense profit gains for AAPL above Street expectations, and First, in the wayback, Steve Jobs and Apple (AAPL) considered Windows a stolen product. Yet the litigation ended with Microsoft (MSFT) winning, supporting the view of Bill Gates that ultimately both AAPL and MSFT got the concepts from Xerox (XRX). Then came Android, another \"stolen product.\" The finger was pointed at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) then-CEO Eric Schmidt, who was simultaneously a director of AAPL when GOOGL changed its development path of its phone operating system. The change was reportedly from a keyboard-based device and system with a small screen that mimicked Blackberry (BBRY) to one that was a touchscreen-sensitive, iPhone-like one. But iPhone had not been divulged yet by AAPL. Thus Jobs famously said that he was ready to go to thermonuclear war over Android, spending every dollar of AAPL's then-$40 B stash if necessary. All of that bluster merely led to a series of legal jousts with a major Android licensee of GOOGL, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), leading to much sound and fury but little else. Even though when iPhone launched in 2007, and for several years after that, Android either did not exist as a commercial product or was such a poor OS that iPhone, and then iPad beginning in 2010, were all that mattered in touchscreen devices. But, dramatically, by 2013, iDevice sales began falling far behind Android, and the chatter was that AAPL's iOS and iDevices were at high risk of suffering the same marginalization that Mac computers suffered to Windows-based personal computers. But AAPL does not forget, may not forgive, and just might enjoy revenge served cold. Here's the case that I'm giving a certain weight to in thinking about AAPL, understanding that there are no certainties. iPhone - moving to #1 in share of dollars spent? Consider: More and more, it is becoming a 2-horse race - AAPL and SSNLF. And, AAPL is doing so well that we see this from Feb. 20: Note, different analytic shops come up with different interpretations of the data. Yet I think the strong growth in iPhone sales recently in a maturing smartphone sector support the view that the iPhone is in fact gaining dollar volume share in the global smartphone market. People lined up for the iPhone X, the first lines I have seen for a new iPhone release in quite a while. Here's the argument for this trend, if real, to continue and swell. The underlying basis is this brief point: The real champ is the iPhone Here is the key point from AAPL's iPhone X web page: In other words, only AAPL truly has a vision of where things are going. All the others, SSNLF, Google itself with its low-selling smartphones, etc., are just followers that are reduced to developing some 'wow' specs here and there. But, AAPL asserts that it is setting the agenda, and that AAPL's overriding agenda is against Android: in the old Reagan line about his vision for the Cold War, that \"we win, they lose.\" AAPL actually wants to defeat Android, not just lead in the high end of the market. The non-champ: the Galaxy line For now, the iPhone X has wrong-footed the competition. As an example, the web page for the Galaxy S9/S9+ shows a picture of the device, but angles the shot in such a way and against a black background so that the top bezel is almost impossible to discern, and the lower half of the phone is not even shown. The page mostly shows the back of the phone, and instead of AAPL's intriguing and visionary \"hello to the future,\" all SSNLF can do to tout its device is this: That's all? They are still focusing on the battle of camera specs? The S9 series is a reasonable competitor to the iPhone 8 series; pricing is very similar. With only half a year to go before AAPL's expected introduction of the successor to the iPhone X, it looks to be at least a year ahead of the competition. By itself, the X is just another leapfrog in favor of iPhone. But now there's a context that can tip the scales in a durable fashion: It's increasingly about the ecosystem I now think of AAPL as a business to be valued as having four parts in addition to its net-cash positive balance sheet. These parts are: The first of those bullet points described a wearable/quasi-wearable ecosystem of products. After all, all better smartphones meet the initial criteria for iPhone that Steve Jobs laid out in 2007 in introducing it: What differentiates the iPhone from Android, with SSNLF the only credible global high end competitor? One aspect is the coolness of the X; but that's also temporary and does not deal anything close to a knockout punch. However, the ecosystem of the Watch and AirPods can differentiate the iPhone and thus drive sales. AAPL has \"done it again\" with both devices. The Apple Watch is so successful that in less than three years since reaching market, not just one but two industries are shrinking badly. One industry is basic wristwatches, which themselves were innovations many decades ago, replacing large timepieces (watches attached to clothing via fobs etc.). This industry has now gotten sick. The other industry that the Watch is disrupting is everyone else's digital wrist device. Fitbit (FIT), we hardly knew ye! The Apple Watch is on track for major growth. Working as a cellphone without an iPhone nearby (\"untethered\"), it is useful in many ways and is a perfect complement to the iPhone. The Watch is all one needs to be in tough when doing such things as jogging or hiking, taking a train into the city to see a show, or just being in one's house but far from the iPhone. The Watch is going to drive iPhone market share gains in my humble opinion. Then there the unexpected hit of AirPods. Are they going to make wired headphones look obsolete? I don't think they are expensive enough to make a big difference to AAPL's financial results, but I believe that along with the Watch, they can help drive people in significant numbers to iPhones. That rise of AAPL's wearables that sync with iPhones presents a new reason for people to buy iPhones. AAPL is thrilled if people who might want the iPhone X find it too expensive and \"settle\" for an 8 series phone, SE or whatever; it basically wants its user base to grow. For the price of an X, someone can have a low-end iPhone (still a great phone), AirPods, and an Apple Watch series 3 with untethered phone connectivity. How can Android beat this value proposition? It cannot. Only AAPL could create this ecosystem, a walled garden as it were. It took single-minded focus, and it took all sorts of esoteric expertise, much of it acquired. One of the less appreciated aspects of AAPL comes from its frequent purchases of small operating companies. The manager of a privately held technology fund that invests in these sorts of companies told me recently that some of their greatest disappointments have come from buying into a company, hoping for the proverbial 10-bagger; and then along comes AAPL and buys the entire company, leaving the tech fund with a modest gain. AAPL is everywhere it wants to be. In summary, AAPL now has a double advantage in the smartphone war. First, it is forcing even best-in-class Android devices to compete with AAPL's next-best line, the 8 series, while AAPL greets the future with the X and the next, improved version of the X. Second, only AAPL offers best-in-class wearables that work seamlessly with its smartphone. I think this set-up could well turn the tide. No guarantees, but in a practical sense, the upside to AAPL stock is vast, given that AAPL is trading at a severe P/E discount to the market. This possibility is a sort of freebie for AAPL investors in my humble opinion. There's more. There's the future. AAPL moves toward even greater control of its fate The expanding AAPL ecosystem involves much more than product ecosystems and even more than greater and greater control of its systems-on-chips; even the AirPod uses an AAPL-designed microprocessor. But AAPL's ambitions against SSNLF and others go farther, as Mark Gurman reports for Bloomberg on Sunday: In other words, AAPL wants to take as much profit as it can take for itself, while strategically doubling down on secrecy; and of course to do so with the goal of controlling a first-in-class/best-in-class technology. (And divorce from SSNLF as much as possible.) The iPhone X introduces AR Most people are expecting AAPL to do some improved, more stylish version of Google Glass for its AR entry, given the cumbersome nature of iPhones for many AR applications. I wonder if it's that simple. Given AAPL's history in which one product helps lead to another, perhaps the Apple Watch and/or AirPods will play a role in image projection and other aspects of delivering an AR experience. After all, many/most of us own eyeglasses. People go to doctors to receive prescriptions to see better. We wear sunglasses. And so on. I do think that AAPL can potentially introduce AR non-prescription glasses in a way that they are stylish and \"just work.\" But dealing with prescription glasses and different glasses we have for sunlight, night driving, etc. may be quite a challenge. Therefore, perhaps AAPL is also considering alternative AR solutions. Perhaps the Apple Watch can serve to project images; perhaps the AirPods would tie in to supplement AR images with voice/sound input. Whatever is coming, understanding that all investing involves risk, I trust AAPL to make AR happen in a way that is convenient to use. No one is going to look like a dork with an AAPL-designed AR apparatus. I expect progress on AR, ARKit, and perhaps new AR apps to be announced at the upcoming WWDC. If not this year, then next. AAPL intends to use its current lead with the X, and its wearable ecosystem commanding lead, to become the AR leader. The importance to AAPL's stock of beating consensus on iPhone sales At some point, the iPhone may fade away to be replaced by Watches, AR-enabling devices, the AirPods as phones, etc. But for the foreseeable future, if the iPhone can materially beat expectations, then AAPL shares can provide alpha. Consensus expectations for AAPL's revenues are for $263 B this fiscal year, rising to $294 B in FY 2021. That would be OK, but given the growth of the App Store, Apple Music, the Watch and AirPods, I think that these expectations embody no growth or decline in iPhone sales by dollar volume. (Above Avalon presents this view of the iPhone's prospects in a recent article.) If iPhone can do much better than thought, there could be both EPS leverage and the stock could grow its absolute and relative P/E. Risks AAPL spends time describing risk factors to investing in the stock in its 10-K and other filings and documents. Investors should be aware of them. In addition, the general tenor of the long/strong move up in leading tech stocks the last few years produces tendencies to profit-taking. AAPL is part of that group of stocks and is not immune to technical selling. Finally, the Fed is making money tighter. All stocks tend to eventually come under pressure in that setting. Conclusions: AAPL is, as usual, underestimated The advantage of value-based investing is that if bullish theses such as the possibility discussed in this article do not pan out, well, they were not incorporated in the stock price anyway, so nothing - or close to nothing - is lost by the investor by betting on them. So - I like the odds on AAPL here. But not only for this reason. AAPL as a unitary, almost monolithic, expanding force has other ways to establish unexpected dominance. It is growing within the business sector.That could provide alpha to the stock, as business sales receive higher multiples than sales to consumers. Also, the Mac line may surprise people; it is competing against a fragmented Windows ecosystem just as iPhone/iPad are competing against a fragmented Android ecosystem. The monolith has the long term advantage: it cares more about the product, and it knows more about it. Whereas, MSFT is now in so many spaces that it can move on from Windows if need be. So can the assemblers who license Windows. As the \"personal computer\" segment gets very mature, the Mac may have more upside potential than thought, perhaps much more. I believe that one shifts the odds towards oneself in buying such a dominant, innovative force as AAPL at a 1/3 or so forward discount to the multiple of the SPY. Tim Cook, AAPL's CEO, observed philosophically in the November conference call that he had been with AAPL for two decades and the company had been underestimated the whole time. That still appears to be the case. I think that it is possible that AAPL investors could have a double win in the next few years: sales and earnings could beat expectations, and the stock's absolute and relative P/E can expand. That's a sort of nirvana possibility; one or the other would be fine. Overall, understanding there are various risks, I think the bull case for AAPL remains strong.

Investors should be aware of them. In addition, the general tenor of the long/strong move up in leading tech stocks the last few years produces tendencies to profit-taking. AAPL is part of that group of stocks and is not immune to technical selling. Finally, the Fed is making money tighter. All stocks tend to eventually come under pressure in that setting.</p> \n <p>Conclusions: AAPL is, as usual, underestimated</p> \n <p>The advantage of value-based investing is that if bullish theses such as the possibility discussed in this article do not pan out, well, they were not incorporated in the stock price anyway, so nothing - or close to nothing - is lost by the investor by betting on them. So - I like the odds on AAPL here.</p> \n <p>But not only for this reason. AAPL as a unitary, almost monolithic, expanding force has other ways to establish unexpected dominance. It is growing within the business sector.That could provide alpha to the stock, as business sales receive higher multiples than sales to consumers.</p> \n <p>Also, the Mac line may surprise people; it is competing against a fragmented Windows ecosystem just as iPhone/iPad are competing against a fragmented Android ecosystem. The monolith has the long term advantage: it cares more about the product, and it knows more about it. Whereas, MSFT is now in so many spaces that it can move on from Windows if need be. So can the assemblers who license Windows. As the \"personal computer\" segment gets very mature, the Mac may have more upside potential than thought, perhaps much more.</p> \n <p>I believe that one shifts the odds towards oneself in buying such a dominant, innovative force as AAPL at a 1/3 or so forward discount to the multiple of the SPY. Tim Cook, AAPL's CEO, observed philosophically in the November conference call that he had been with AAPL for two decades and the company had been underestimated the whole time. That still appears to be the case.</p> \n <p>I think that it is possible that AAPL investors could have a double win in the next few years: sales and earnings could beat expectations, and the stock's absolute and relative P/E can expand. That's a sort of nirvana possibility; one or the other would be fine. Overall, understanding there are various risks, I think the bull case for AAPL remains strong.</p> \n <p>Thanks for reading and sharing any comments you wish to contribute.</p> \n <p>Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. </p> \n <p>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Thishas kept Danish pharmaceutical Novo Nordisk (NVO) at the forefront of my mind as this is one of the firms specializing in treating this horrible disease. Lately however, the firm has expanded from merely treating it to trying to prevent it by attacking one of its root causes, obesity. It should come as no surprise that one of the biggest health problems facing America today is obesity. According to the State of Obesity, more than 35% are obese in five states, 30% in 25 states, and 25% in 46 states. There are only four states in which less than 25% of adults are obese. Source: State of Obesity This is a problem that has been growing much more prevalent over the past generation. Source: State of Obesity While there are certainly a few reasons for the sharp increase in obesity rates, there are two that are likely primary causes. The first of these is an increasing lack of physical activity. In past generations, Americans as a whole had more physical jobs than today. But with the decline in manufacturing and evolution into a service economy, Americans spend much of their working hours sitting in front of a computer screen instead of physically moving around a factory floor. In addition, Americans spend an increasing portion of their recreational time doing non-physical activities such as watching television or utilizing various electronic devices. Anecdotally, I virtually never see any of my neighbors outside in the upper middle-class suburb where I live. The second reason for the increasing obesity rate is diet. The average diet consists of a sizable amount of pre-cooked processed foods that are nowhere near as healthy as the cooked-from-scratch meals that our parents and grandparents ate. When combined with a lack of physical activity, this is a recipe for obesity. There are numerous health problems that can be directly caused by obesity. According to WebMD, being obese makes a person more at risk of developing these conditions: Given these health problems associated with diabetes, it should come as no surprise that there is a growing market for solutions meant to help people improve their health. This includes things such as diets and weight loss foods, devices such as Apple's (AAPL) iWatch and other fitness trackers, and weight loss drugs. One of the newest entries on the list is Novo Nordisk's Saxenda. Saxenda is an interesting product that has its roots in the company's GLP-1 analogue liraglutide (Victoza) that's used for treatment of type-2 diabetes. As I explained in a previous article on Novo Nordisk, it was discovered fairly early on that one of the more prevalent side effects of Victoza was weight loss. The pharmaceutical company used this fact and reformulated Victoza for use as a weight management drug. With that said, Saxenda is not actually a weight loss drug as such but is intended for use as part of a weight management program for chronically obese individuals. Along with a refined diet and exercise program, it has been shown to help these individuals reduce their weight and keep it off. Although Saxenda is relatively new to the market, there's already evidence that the product is becoming popular for patient treatment. This chart shows Saxenda's value market share of each market in which it has launched and how long it took to achieve that share: Source: Novo Nordisk As shown here, Saxenda has become quite a popular medication for the treatment of chronic obesity in most of the markets in which it has launched and accomplished it in relatively short order (30 months is only two and a half years, after all). As might be expected, the United States, with its already discussed obesity problem, is by far the biggest market for Saxenda. Source: Novo Nordisk Even with this rapid sales growth, there's still considerable room for growth. This is due to the fact that despite the high level of obesity in the United States, the market for obesity care in the United States is still relatively small at only $700 million. Fortunately, there are some reasons to believe that the obesity care market will grow considerably in the United States going forward. The primary reason to expect the market to grow going forward is the sheer size of it. As I already mentioned, all but four states have a population in which more than 25% of adults are obese. It is a total of approximately 95 million adults. Unfortunately, currently only 40% of these people have access to obesity management medicines through their healthcare plans. The rest would have to either purchase it out of pocket or go without, with the second choice being the default option for most people. Novo Nordisk, among other pharmaceutical firms, has sought to change this by lobbying members of Congress to support the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which has been introduced in Congress a few times over the past few years, most recently in 2017. This bill would provide coverage for medications designed for weight loss management under Medicare Part D, which would clearly include Saxenda. If this bill or a similar one passes, it would open up a large segment of the potential markt to Saxenda and result in profit growth for Novo Nordisk. There are reasons to expect that this bill will pass or that the United States and other nations will take steps to improve the treatment of obesity. The reason for optimism is costs. Globally, there are approximately 650 million people who struggle with obesity and the costs of treating health conditions related to this obesity are approximately $800 billion annually ($550 billion in the United States alone). By 2025, the number of obese people globally is expected to grow to approximately one billion with total treatment costs of approximately $1.2 trillion. Source: World Obesity Federation, Novo Nordisk Governments all around the world have been struggling with their finances for several years now (and most healthcare services in the developed world are financed directly or indirectly by governments), so it seems logical to assume that they would act to improve and increase the use of obesity management drugs such as Saxenda rather than pay the much higher costs of treating the aforementioned conditions linked to obesity. In the past, I have argued that Novo Nordisk will benefit from the obesity epidemic due to its diabetes care products as type-2 diabetes is directly linked to obesity. Now, the company looks to gain a second benefit from the obesity epidemic as it moves to combat obesity directly through the use of its weight management drug. While the market is still smaller in the United Statesthan it would otherwise be due to a lack of healthcare coverage, this situation is facing mounting pressure to improve so it seems logical that we will see this portion of the potential market open up in short order, further increasing Novo Nordisk's customer base.", "publishDate": "2018-02-21T18:20:49", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>A few days ago, I was notified that a long-time friend of mine finally lost her lifelong fight with diabetes and passed away.

Bullish Sentiment is literally off the charts and only 7,826 (11.4%) out of 68,119 investors polled by Earnings Whispers are currently bearish about the markets. Usually you might thing that's the sign of a turn but if my daughter's softball team were going up against the Yankees, you might see similar sentiment results in favor of the Yankees and that does NOT mean betting against the Yankees is a smart move - just because it's the contrarian play. Sometimes, the crowd gets things right though not this time - this time the crowd is full of idiots who are chasing a trend off a cliff but other times, you shouldn't just be a knee-jerk contrarian. Our Money Talk Portfolio we looked at on November 29 was \"only\" up 70.7% for the year and, this morning, those untouched positions are now up 80.9% less than two months later. We cashed our other portfolios in and started new ones on Jan 2nd and our $500,000 Long-Term Portfolio is already up $25,000 (5%) in 3 weeks - a pace that will make us $1Bn in 14 years (at 75% annualized) and of course that's ridiculous and unsustainable. While earnings are \"pretty good\" so far, they are (as I mentioned in yesterday's Report) bolstered by a weak Dollar as well as the stimulus of a $1.5Tn Tax Cut, which consumers have already borrowed against to spend last Christmas. Looking forward, we are now counting on the repatriation of Trillions of overseas Dollars to boost the markets into 2018 but, just like the rising income inequality in America, the benefits of the repatriation are concentrated to the Top 1% Corporations and, in fact, just 16 companies account for half of all overseas funds: What we have here is the Oligopolists consolidating their power and sure, we can bet on those companies to do very well down the road but beware if you hold stock in their competition - this is not unlike the game Monopoly, when your competitors start the game with 10 times more money than you - you are not likely to win and will likely go bankrupt as you try your best to move around the board without landing on one of their hotels. So, believe it or not, 2018 is going to become a stock picker's market and there will be losers as well as winners and the problem with that is currently the indexes are not pricing in any losers at all - so the valuations are stretched across the board. Yesterday, we discussed Cisco (CSCO) and, while they are one of my favorite stocks and will be bringing back $76Bn from overseas, they are not cheap at $42.30 as that's a market cap of $208Bn and they \"only\" make $10Bn a year, so 20 times earnings. The repatriated cash is not \"new money\" - it's already on their books and has already been earned - it's just being moved around. Instead we prefer in that space Finisar (FNSR), who are a $2Bn company at $19 and made $250M last year for a p/e of 8 and are growing revenues and profits at a 15% annual pace. THAT is the kind of company we like to put in our portfolios and we did add FNSR to our Options Opportunity Portfolio as well as our Long-Term Portfolio already. Again, it's not that we don't like, even LOVE CSCO - it's just that they are not on sale - so why buy them? Also yesterday we played with the Futures and our trade of the day was a long on the Russell Futures (/TF) as they dipped in the afternoon and we made a very quick $280 in our trading demonstration and the Russell went on to hit 1,610, good for gains of another $700 per contract for those who stuck with it so congratulations to all who attended yesterday. Last Wednesday, our Webinar play was a long on Coffee (/KC) Futures at $120 and this morning we're testing $125 but we took the money and ran at our usual $123. Coffee contracts pay $375 for each $1 move so up $1,125 per contract was a nice gain for our Members and, if you are just a webinar watcher - I'd say it's a bit greedy not to take some off the table at $125 and keep tight stops on the rest as the main reason we like tradin coffee is because it keeps pulling back and giving us new entry opportunities though, long-term, we certainly expect it to move much higher than it is now. For the Futures-challenged there's a Coffee ETF (JO) which is subject to a bit of decay but is still playable at $15.21 and the way we would lay out a trade would be: That nets you into the $6,000 spread that's $1,210 in the money for $600 so your upside potential is $5,400, which would be a 900% return on cash and the margin for selling 5 short 2020 $16 puts is about $1,500 and your ultimate obligation is to own 500 shares of JO for $16 ($8,000) if it's assigned to you but then you can turn around and sell the $14 calls for $3.75 and your basis drops down to $12.25 so the risk of being long on JO at net $12.85 (the $600 cash presumed lost as well) is a risk that compares very favorably with the potential $5,400 reward so we'll add that one to our Options Opportunity Portfolio and see how it plays out. Of course, going long just one Futures contract at $130 and running up the same 25% to $162 would pay $12,000 and the Coffee contracts only require $2,310 in margin and, even better, we go in and out and in and out and make money on all the little move in between so, if all goes well, we'll make much, much more than $12,000 per contract over the next couple of years in the Futures. Here's a bonus trade that seems very silly to me with the Dollar so low (see yesterday's notes) and gold so high: Barrick Gold (ABX) is a quality miner with a very low cost of extracts (under $800) and, with gold hitting $1,360 this morning - it seems hard to imagine that Q4 earnings won't be better than last year's Q4, when gold averaged under $1,200 per ounce. ABX spiked to $20 after Q4 earnings last year so $15 seems like a bargain at the moment. A simple way to get bullish on earnings is to pick up the Feb $15 calls for 0.55, which is 0.50 in premium but that's all the risk you have and there is no margin requirement. If ABX breaks up ahead of earnings and the calls hit $1, you can sell half and then carry no risk into the earnings and any move up from there is all bonus money. We are carrying longer-term spreads on ABX in both the Long-Term Portfolio and the Options Opportunity Portfolio and we have high degrees of confidence in them. Another fun gamble on Gold is micro-miner Northern Dynasty (NAK), which we also hold in the OOP and that's just $1.60 but pure speculation as they don't mine at all but they are trying to get regulatory approvals and partners to begin mining up in Alaska. What we like about NAK is that getting permits to strip mine the land and pollute the rivers is much, much easier under the current administration so yay Capitalism! Meanwhile, if this rally doesn't calm down - we're going to need a bigger chart (we are shorting Nasdaq Futures (/NQ) below the 7,000 line with tight stops above as well as S&P Futures (/ES) below the 2,850 line.

Again, it's not that we don't like, even LOVE CSCO - it's just that they are not on sale - so why buy them?</p> \n <p>Also yesterday we played with the Futures and our trade of the day was a long on the Russell Futures (/TF) as they dipped in the afternoon and we made a very quick $280 in our trading demonstration and the Russell went on to hit 1,610, good for gains of another $700 per contract for those who stuck with it so congratulations to all who attended yesterday. </p> \n <p>Last Wednesday, our Webinar play was a long on Coffee (/KC) Futures at $120 and this morning we're testing $125 but we took the money and ran at our usual $123. Coffee contracts pay $375 for each $1 move so up $1,125 per contract was a nice gain for our Members and, if you are just a webinar watcher - I'd say it's a bit greedy not to take some off the table at $125 and keep tight stops on the rest as the main reason we like tradin coffee is because it keeps pulling back and giving us new entry opportunities though, long-term, we certainly expect it to move much higher than it is now.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For the Futures-challenged there's a Coffee ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JO\">JO</a>) which is subject to a bit of decay but is still playable at $15.21 and the way we would lay out a trade would be:</p> \n <p>That nets you into the $6,000 spread that's $1,210 in the money for $600 so your upside potential is $5,400, which would be a 900% return on cash and the margin for selling 5 short 2020 $16 puts is about $1,500 and your ultimate obligation is to own 500 shares of JO for $16 ($8,000) if it's assigned to you but then you can turn around and sell the $14 calls for $3.75 and your basis drops down to $12.25 so the risk of being long on JO at net $12.85 (the $600 cash presumed lost as well) is a risk that compares very favorably with the potential $5,400 reward so we'll add that one to our Options Opportunity Portfolio and see how it plays out.</p> \n <p>Of course, going long just one Futures contract at $130 and running up the same 25% to $162 would pay $12,000 and the Coffee contracts only require $2,310 in margin and, even better, we go <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSYgRYlhMW4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m5s\">in and out and in and out</a> and make money on all the little move in between so, if all goes well, we'll make much, much more than $12,000 per contract over the next couple of years in the Futures. </p> \n <p>Here's a bonus trade that seems very silly to me with the Dollar so low (see yesterday's notes) and gold so high: Barrick Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABX\">ABX</a>) is a quality miner with a very low cost of extracts (under $800) and, with gold hitting $1,360 this morning - it seems hard to imagine that Q4 earnings won't be better than last year's Q4, when gold averaged under $1,200 per ounce. ABX spiked to $20 after Q4 earnings last year so $15 seems like a bargain at the moment.</p> \n <p>A simple way to get bullish on earnings is to pick up the Feb $15 calls for 0.55, which is 0.50 in premium but that's all the risk you have and there is no margin requirement. If ABX breaks up ahead of earnings and the calls hit $1, you can sell half and then carry no risk into the earnings and any move up from there is all bonus money. We are carrying longer-term spreads on ABX in both the Long-Term Portfolio and the Options Opportunity Portfolio and we have high degrees of confidence in them. </p> \n <p>Another fun gamble on Gold is micro-miner Northern Dynasty (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NAK\">NAK</a>), which we also hold in the OOP and that's just $1.60 but pure speculation as they don't mine at all but they are trying to get regulatory approvals and partners to begin mining up in Alaska. What we like about NAK is that getting permits to strip mine the land and pollute the rivers is much, much easier under the current administration so yay Capitalism! </p> \n <p>Meanwhile, if this rally doesn't calm down - we're going to need a bigger chart (we are shorting Nasdaq Futures (/NQ) below the 7,000 line with tight stops above as well as S&amp;P Futures (/ES) below the 2,850 line.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Disclosure: I am/we are long FNSR, JO, NAK, ABX, SQQQ, TZA, DXD, SDS, AAPL, IMAX, LB, WPM. </p> \n <p>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

(AAPL) trading near all-time highs, the current slowdown in the stock could provide investors an opportunity to buy prior to the next earnings release on February 1st. The company is poised to continue its growth on the heels of its latest and greatest iPhone, but it is other areas of the business that are not getting enough attention that will propel the stock higher. In addition, the company reported that it will repatriate much of their overseas cash, which will provide numerous opportunities for management, which will have a sizable impact on the company. After publishing my recent AAPL article, \u201cIs Apple A Buy At These Levels?\u201d, in mid-November, the stock has been in a slowdown, trading between $170 and $175 for much of the time. After writing that article, and listening to those that commented, I decided to recently jump aboard the Apple ship. I will discuss the reasons in further detail as to the fact why I have missed the boat too often and really like where the company is headed, as it lessens its reliance on the iPhone. In addition, I believe the repatriation of most of their overseas cash will pay huge dividends (not those types of dividends, but you know what I mean), which are not baked into the price in my opinion. Since the announcement of their new iPhone products in mid-September, the stock has gained about 9.6%. So far in 2018, the stock is up 1.7%, while the S&P 500 continues its upward trend, up 5.1% during the year. Concerns around the sales of the new iPhone 8 and iPhone X, battery issues with the iPhone 8, LTE connectivity issues with the new iWatch Series 3, and delay of the iPhone X, have all added increased pressure to the stock as of late. Battery issues and the connectivity with the iWatch have all been resolved, but recent reports released from analysts are predicting that demand for the new iPhones are slow and forecasts will be slashed during the next earnings release on February 1st. If I had a dollar for every time I saw a report like this, I would be rich! To be fair, some have been correct in the past, but most of the time, they are overblown. The first report, which has been called into question, came from a Sinolink Securities Co. analyst Zhang Bin stating: In addition to this report, JL Warren Capital LLC reported shipments would drop from 30 million units to 25 million units in Q1 2018. During Q1, AAPL typically ships between 50-55 million units on average, meaning if the 25 million estimates were correct, iPhone X would account for about 50% of the sales mix. Having the higher than normal price point for the iPhone X, I think a break from normal is to be expected with the higher price point making up the difference in addition to a better margin. Some analysts have already responded to the report saying the analysts are confusing cuts in the iPhone 8 with that of the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 has been out about a month and a half longer than the X, and it also does not include all the upgraded features that came with the X. This merely seems like a \u201cbuy the fake news\u201d situation more than anything. As of this week, JP Morgan analyst Narci Chang wrote in a research note that \u201chigh-end smartphones are clearly hitting a plateau this year, with the iPhone X orders being down 50% quarter over quarter.\u201d Other analysts are more optimistic reporting that the iPhone X was the world\u2019s best shipping smartphone during the holidays with an expected 29 million units shipped in the most recent quarter. We will get our answer in about a week. The company\u2019s most recent earnings release related to their Q4 and 2017 annual results as of September 30, in which they had a tremendous final quarter. Apple reported Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 vs. $1.87 expected by analysts. Revenue for the quarter topped $52.6 billion with analysts expecting $50.7 billion. Lastly, analysts expected iPhone unit sales to be at 46 million units, which Apple surpassed by selling 46.7 million units. As you can see, the company blew away expectations on every major item above. Looking at the year-to date results, Apple reported an increase in revenue, net income, and EPS of 6.3%, 5.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. Gross margins for the period were 38.5%, which is the second annual decrease in margin. Gross margins decreased 60 basis points from 2016 and 160 basis points from 2015. These are modest growth numbers compared to what investors got during the company\u2019s best year of 2015. When comparing to 2015, revenue was down 1.9%, net income was down 9.4%, and EPS was flat. Though the 2017 results compare positively to prior year results, it\u2019s the lack of growth since 2015 that causes some concern. Overall units were down as well when comparing to 2015 by about 14 million iPhone units and 4 million iPad units. Mac unit sales were flat while real growth came from the services department. As I mentioned in my thesis, one of the areas that excite me the most about the company is its lessening reliance on the iPhone. Though the iPhone is still the main driver and continues to perform well, growth in other areas, particularly services revenue, has changed the sales mix. As you can see in the chart below, iPhone sales continue to be the main source of revenue, with over 60% of revenue related to its flagship product. Source: Chart created by author As mentioned, the growth in services revenue has been a major focus of the company moving forward as the segment has grown over 450 basis points, in terms of sales mix since the end of 2015 and is now the second largest reportable segment for the company. Apple Music continues to be a solid growth driver for the company with revenues up 75% year over year during the quarter. The company is seeing their highest conversion rates yet, based on users who try the Apple Music system for free and convert to a paid subscription. In terms of subscriptions, the company now has over 210 million paid subscriptions, a 25 million subscription net increase since June 30, 2017. Sales and units sold reached all-time highs in China during the most recent quarter based on the new offerings from the company. Q4 was the second consecutive quarter in which the company saw double-digit growth in terms of iPad unit sales. Apple Watch continues to be the best selling smartwatch available to consumers today, as they saw 50% growth for the third consecutive quarter. In terms of region, Americas continue to lead the charge with over 42% of total revenues coming from this region, followed by Europe and China, which account for 24% and 20% respectively of total revenues. Looking at the chart below, you can see the regions have been pretty consistent for the most part with the exception of China, which is a cause for concern. However, the company did see a return to strong growth during the most recent quarter. China sales for the quarter were up 12% year over year, which should continue with the release of the new iPhones. Emerging markets outside of China saw revenue increase 40% during the quarter with sales doubling in India as the company continues to enlarge their footprint in that country as wireless availability strengthens. Source: Chart created by author Innovation has always been the key to Apple\u2019s success since the release of the iPhone 1 back in 2007. Releasing innovative products with top of the line new technology has been what keeps Apple ticking. However, the question always arises from numerous bears on SA or elsewhere: can the company continue to innovate. Based on the track record, and the current products recently released, I would say the company is doing just fine. As you can see, Apple has breathed new life into not only their bestselling product, the iPhone, with the iPhone X, but also their fastest growing product, the Apple Watch. Just this past week, Apple announced plans to repatriate much of their $270 billion in overseas cash and contribute $350 billion to the US economy over the next five years, due to the recent tax cut bill that was signed. The new tax bill cuts corporate tax rates from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. The company\u2019s 2017 effective tax rate was 24.6%, so the new bill will have a positive impact here. The potential impact of the cash being repatriated could go in various routes, as management could use the cash to increase buybacks, increase dividends, pursue larger acquisitions, or even pay down debt. Obviously, all potential routes will serve the company very well, thus providing returns to shareholders one way or another. In terms of which route I prefer, I would lean towards stock buybacks. I know this may not be a popular answer, as Nicholas Ward alluded to in his article \u201cInvestors Complaining About Apple's Buyback Potential Baffles Me,\u201d but taking a long-term approach will be extremely beneficial, not that the other routes would not, but just a preference. As we alluded to earlier, growth in the service segment is something we should watch closely going forward. The service segment includes Apple Music, Apple Care, Apple Pay, and the main driver, the App Store. The company reported segment revenue of $30 billion during 2017 and they have a goal to reach $48 billion by 2020. This week, CNBC Trading Nation had BK Asset Management Managing Director of FX Strategy Boris Schlossberg on the show where he practically announced the demise of Apple. He took issue with the high dollar amount Apple is selling many of their recent products, such as the iPhone X at $999 and the new HomePod that fetches a $349 price tag. He stated that the HomePod will be as big of a \u201cfailure\u201d as the iPhone X, and that \u201cnobody is going to buy it at such high price points.\u201d Now that seems a little extreme to me. It as if he needed some airtime and what better time to be an \u201cApple Bear\u201d than when JPMorgan reports \u201cslowing iPhone X orders\u201d on the same day. I, however, do not have the same view as Mr. Schlossberg. Is Apple late to the game with the HomePod, absolutely, but the fact that they did not want to release the product until it was perfected in their minds, is a sound business decision. Mr. Schlossberg also downplayed the cash being repatriated as a \u201cone-time event and bad business decision.\u201d I am not sure how this is a one-time event where the company can now buy back shares (long-term effect when dividends increase), or make a solid acquisition (long-term effect). It is not like they obtained a massive one-time sales contract that will never be repeated. Overall, I thought the interview was bogus and someone looking for airtime. One interesting note I did read, as it related to the Verizon Communications (VZ) earnings release, was their recent upgrade rate during their most recent quarter. VZ released earnings this week and during the conference call, they alluded to a lower than normal upgrade rate of 7.2%, which is well below previous upgrade rates during prior iPhone launches. How much weight can we put into this? Not really sure myself, but it was interesting to say the least. Based on the recent slowdown in the stock since November 2017, partly due to various reports speculating on iPhone 8 and iPhone X orders, the stock appears to be forming a new base that may be a solid entry point for those looking to ride the next wave up. Looking at the F.A.S.T. Graph chart below, the stock appears to be increasing at a faster rate than earnings. Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs AAPL stock has been on a tear for the last five years, gaining over 160% in value. The company has continued to launch new innovative products that have resonated with consumers fueling higher growth, yet some bearish investors still wonder whether the pipeline is reaching its tipping point. I feel as if we have heard this story from bears for years, but the company continues to prove them wrong. Now if a bear has a view based on valuation, I can see that, but when they question one of the most, if not the most, innovative company of all time, it tends to get a little old and not have much relevance. Currently, the stock trades at a blended P/E of 17.9x (according to FAST Graphs) compared to its five-year average of 13.5x. This indicates that at current levels, the stock appears to be overvalued. However, AAPL does trade at a premium as it has continued to grow at a solid clip, but someone stating the stock is overvalued would not be a baseless comment. Due to the super cycle that is taking place with the release of three new iPhones, I do feel that the premium above the recent norm is warranted. In terms of free cash flow, the company currently trades at a P/FCF of 17.9x compared to their five-year average of 10.5x, again indicating the stock is overvalued. In terms of Price to Sales, the stock currently trades at a P/S of 4.0x compared to a five-year average of 2.7x. As you know, AAPL is a cash cow, with nearly $270 billion in cash and marketable securities as of their latest annual filing. The company currently pays a dividend yielding 1.42% and has a payout ratio of only 27%. The combination of positive cash flows combined with a low payout ratio excites me as a DGI investor, as it indicates the company has tons of room to grow the dividend over time. Each of the last four years, the company has increased the dividend an average of 10% per year, which makes for a solid selection for any DGI portfolio with a long-term horizon. The prospect of double-digit dividend growth combined with aggressive stock appreciation bodes well for most investors. Photo Credit Based on the metrics above, the stock currently appears to be overvalued; however, rarely do you get an opportunity to pick up a blue chip stock on sale. One must look at these metrics as a start but they cannot be the sole decision makers. As an investor, one must analyze the true fundamentals of the company combined with their moat and potential growth moving forward to determine if the premium today presents value in the years ahead. Though AAPL appears to be overvalued, I believe the product innovation will continue in the future, which will propel this stock on an upward trend for years to come. Many bears are negative on the price of the new iPhones being too high, but I believe consumers will still upgrade, the increase in ASP should bode well for not only top line growth but bottom line growth as well. I am a mid-30s investor myself looking to secure my family\u2019s financial future in our later years, as such, my view point is based on a long term horizon, God willing.

The company\u2019s 2017 effective tax rate was 24.6%, so the new bill will have a positive impact here.</p> \n <p>The potential impact of the cash being repatriated could go in various routes, as management could use the cash to increase buybacks, increase dividends, pursue larger acquisitions, or even pay down debt. Obviously, all potential routes will serve the company very well, thus providing returns to shareholders one way or another.</p> \n <p>In terms of which route I prefer, I would lean towards stock buybacks. I know this may not be a popular answer, as Nicholas Ward alluded to in his article <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4136740-investors-complaining-apples-buyback-potential-baffles\">\u201cInvestors Complaining About Apple's Buyback Potential Baffles Me,\u201d</a> but taking a long-term approach will be extremely beneficial, not that the other routes would not, but just a preference.</p> \n <p>As we alluded to earlier, growth in the service segment is something we should watch closely going forward. The service segment includes Apple Music, Apple Care, Apple Pay, and the main driver, the App Store. The company reported segment revenue of $30 billion during 2017 and they have a goal to reach $48 billion by 2020.</p> \n <p>This week, CNBC Trading Nation had BK Asset Management Managing Director of FX Strategy Boris Schlossberg on the show where he practically announced the demise of Apple. He took issue with the high dollar amount Apple is selling many of their recent products, such as the iPhone X at $999 and the new HomePod that fetches a $349 price tag. He stated that the HomePod will be as big of a \u201cfailure\u201d as the iPhone X, and that \u201cnobody is going to buy it at such high price points.\u201d</p> \n <p>Now that seems a little extreme to me. It as if he needed some airtime and what better time to be an \u201cApple Bear\u201d than when JPMorgan reports \u201cslowing iPhone X orders\u201d on the same day. I, however, do not have the same view as Mr. Schlossberg. Is Apple late to the game with the HomePod, absolutely, but the fact that they did not want to release the product until it was perfected in their minds, is a sound business decision.</p> \n <p>Mr. Schlossberg also downplayed the cash being repatriated as a \u201cone-time event and bad business decision.\u201d I am not sure how this is a one-time event where the company can now buy back shares (long-term effect when dividends increase), or make a solid acquisition (long-term effect). It is not like they obtained a massive one-time sales contract that will never be repeated. Overall, I thought the interview was bogus and someone looking for airtime.</p> \n <p>One interesting note I did read, as it related to the Verizon Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\">VZ</a>) earnings release, was their recent upgrade rate during their most recent quarter. VZ released earnings this week and during the conference call, they alluded to a lower than normal upgrade rate of 7.2%, which is well below previous upgrade rates during prior iPhone launches. How much weight can we put into this? Not really sure myself, but it was interesting to say the least.</p> \n <p>Based on the recent slowdown in the stock since November 2017, partly due to various reports speculating on iPhone 8 and iPhone X orders, the stock appears to be forming a new base that may be a solid entry point for those looking to ride the next wave up. Looking at the F.A.S.T. Graph chart below, the stock appears to be increasing at a faster rate than earnings.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</p> \n <p>AAPL stock has been on a tear for the last five years, gaining over 160% in value. The company has continued to launch new innovative products that have resonated with consumers fueling higher growth, yet some bearish investors still wonder whether the pipeline is reaching its tipping point. I feel as if we have heard this story from bears for years, but the company continues to prove them wrong. Now if a bear has a view based on valuation, I can see that, but when they question one of the most, if not the most, innovative company of all time, it tends to get a little old and not have much relevance.</p> \n <p>Currently, the stock trades at a blended P/E of 17.9x (according to FAST Graphs) compared to its five-year average of 13.5x. This indicates that at current levels, the stock appears to be overvalued. However, AAPL does trade at a premium as it has continued to grow at a solid clip, but someone stating the stock is overvalued would not be a baseless comment.</p> \n <p>Due to the super cycle that is taking place with the release of three new iPhones, I do feel that the premium above the recent norm is warranted. In terms of free cash flow, the company currently trades at a P/FCF of 17.9x compared to their five-year average of 10.5x, again indicating the stock is overvalued. In terms of Price to Sales, the stock currently trades at a P/S of 4.0x compared to a five-year average of 2.7x.</p> \n <p>As you know, AAPL is a cash cow, with nearly $270 billion in cash and marketable securities as of their latest <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019317000070/a10-k20179302017.htm\">annual filing</a>. The company currently pays a dividend yielding 1.42% and has a payout ratio of only 27%. The combination of positive cash flows combined with a low payout ratio excites me as a DGI investor, as it indicates the company has tons of room to grow the dividend over time.</p> \n <p>Each of the last four years, the company has increased the dividend an average of 10% per year, which makes for a solid selection for any DGI portfolio with a long-term horizon. The prospect of double-digit dividend growth combined with aggressive stock appreciation bodes well for most investors.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Photo Credit</p> \n <p>Based on the metrics above, the stock currently appears to be overvalued; however, rarely do you get an opportunity to pick up a blue chip stock on sale. One must look at these metrics as a start but they cannot be the sole decision makers. As an investor, one must analyze the true fundamentals of the company combined with their moat and potential growth moving forward to determine if the premium today presents value in the years ahead.</p> \n <p>Though AAPL appears to be overvalued, I believe the product innovation will continue in the future, which will propel this stock on an upward trend for years to come. Many bears are negative on the price of the new iPhones being too high, but I believe consumers will still upgrade, the increase in ASP should bode well for not only top line growth but bottom line growth as well. I am a mid-30s investor myself looking to secure my family\u2019s financial future in our later years, as such, my view point is based on a long term horizon, God willing.</p> \n <p>I hope everyone enjoyed the article and I look forward to hearing your viewpoints in the comment section above.</p> \n <p>Note:I hope you all enjoyed the article and found it informative.

There continues to be a tremendous amount of institutional capital and private equity looking to find a home in \"growthy\" data centers, with 2017 M&A transactions setting a record. Data center REITs in 2017 continued to build on the momentum of 2016, until they hit a bump in the road in September. A number of developments shook the investment niche toward the end of the year, including proclamations predicting the demise of the data center and technology advances misunderstood by investors. Despite the dour predictions, Bill Stoller, known at Seeking Alpha for his data center REIT analysis and his REITs 4 Alpha service, suggests the recent dip in share price for a number of data center REITs presents an opportunity. Stoller, who worked on this 2018 Outlook presentation with Editor Michael Hopkins, also shares his insight into wireless tower, retail, public-storage and healthcare REITs in the Q&A below. Michael Hopkins (MH): You commented on Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya and his suggestions in September that data center REITs are headed toward extinction. It appears his comments continue to reverberate throughout the business. What's your take on his comments and where data center REITs are headed? Bill Stoller: I was quoted in a rebuttal article written by Data Center Knowledge Editor-in-Chief Yevgeniy Sverdlik, which contained a quote from Chamath Palihapitiya which changed the narrative for a couple of weeks. This comment, among others he made regarding a recent technological advance by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in chip design, triggered a sell-off in data center REIT shares. Suddenly, many investors, including some institutional clients of major investment banks, began to question the viability of data centers owned by third-party landlords. I think the sensational nature of Palihapitiya's quote, made on the \"bully pulpit\" provided by CNBC, clearly impacted share prices. In an SA article the following week, \"Data Center REITs Ignore Palihapitiya's Chip, Buy This Dip,\" I encouraged investors to take advantage of any price dislocations: Additionally, the size of data center powered shells being offered by third-party data center operators in Top Tier US markets with available land is just staggering. In Northern Virginia's \"data center alley,\" Dallas, Phoenix (and more recently Atlanta), these buildings can be 500,000-600,000 square-feet, with multiple \"acre-sized\" data halls, each designed to provide 6 MW (megawatts) of critical IT power, or more. A recent pullback in early December has created another opportunity for investors to initiate or add to their data center REIT holdings. My REITs 4 Alpha: High-Yield | DGI | Technology service recommends all five of these REITs. The purchases and individual stock weighting evolved opportunistically during the year. The biggest change occurred when our largest holding, Dupont Fabros (NYSE:DFT), merged into Digital Realty. DuPont Fabros was focused 100% on large wholesale deployments, with top tenants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and other hyperscale cloud and SaaS providers. During 2017, DuPont Fabros shares had increased in value by ~50% when they were merged into Digital in an all-stock transaction which closed on Sept. 14, 2017, (when the \"magic chip\" kerfuffle began). Notably, the absence of top performer DuPont Fabros in most year-end recaps significantly under-reports overall data center REIT sector performance for 2017. MH: Data center REITs continue to score key deals with big tech. Will tech continue to look toward data center REITs for support? And (this is a question I asked last year) why can't a giant like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google build and operate data center infrastructure on their own? Stoller: The hyperscale public cloud and software as a service (SaaS) giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM (NYSE:IBM) Cloud and Oracle Cloud, as well as social media giant Facebook, and tech giants like Apple (AAPL) tend to follow a dual strategy of owning and leasing data centers. In many cases, these large hyperscalers locate in third-party data centers to make it easier for customers to access their public cloud offerings, as part of a hybrid IT strategy. Secure and fast interconnection with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others can act as a magnet to draw in hundreds of SMB and enterprise data center customers. According to a recent industry report (which did not break out owned vs. leased): Notably, the exponential growth of cloud deployments can make it difficult to predict growth in any given market, (keeping in mind that high-performance applications must be located close to the eyeballs consuming them). Data center REITs have optimized supply chains, helping with a speed-to-market advantage that comes with owning entitled land, and/or an inventory of powered shell space, ready to build out. This is especially the case in higher barrier-to-entry markets like Silicon Valley and Chicago. It is a virtuous cycle, and the rate of public cloud adoption continues to be an important aspect of demand for both retail/colocation and wholesale data centers. One trend to watch is the purchase of land by Google and Facebook in Northern Virginia. Will they partner with developers, or choose to build their own data centers in the largest data center market in the world? If you own shares of FANG stocks, is it is because they own real estate? It is more than likely the ability to sell hardware profitably, and grow a global software business on a massive scale. On the other side of the coin, the enormous investment in sub-sea cable deployments helps the hyperscalers to control their own destiny. MH: What about acquisitions? Could we see some consolidation within the data center space? Stoller: There continues to be a tremendous amount of institutional capital and private equity looking to find a home in \"growthy\" data centers. This has resulted in a record year for data center M&A transactions. In addition to the $7.8 billion DuPont Fabros merger, there were over a dozen other deals which closed during the year, including the Equinix $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) North and Latin America data center business, (previously announced in 2016). Other significant deals included: Peak 10's $1.7 billion purchase of Via West, Digital Bridge leading a $1 billion acquisition of Silicon Valley wholesale provider Vantage Data Centers; Cyxtera acquiring the Century Link (NYSE:CTL) colocation data center portfolio for $1.86 billion (CTL retained a 10% ownership in Cyxtera). Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) followed up the $128 million acquisition of FORTRUST in Denver, and the pending $100 million sale-leaseback purchase of Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore, with a $1.3 billion announced acquisition of IO's US data center business. This was in addition to opening the first phase of its first major greenfield development in Northern Virginia. Equinix just announced a $792 million acquisition of 10 Metronode data centers located in Australia, to be purchased from Ontario Teachers Pension Fund. Equinix had previously announced a $93 million acquisition of a Zenium data center in Istanbul, Turkey. While this list is far from inclusive, it does mention many of the larger deals which total over $18 billion, anchoring the largest M&A year for data centers. Back in January, I predicted an active year for M&A, but the voracious appetite by both public and privately held buyers was totally off the charts in 2017. This slide from Digital Realty's Dec. 5, 2017 Investor Day presentation is more comprehensive, and shows how 2017 was truly an \"epic\" year when it came to data center deals. MH: How about wireless/tower REITs? Stoller: We closely cover wireless tower and fiber infrastructure, keeping an eye on American Tower (NYSE:AMT), Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC). One of the big themes this year has been the confluence of wireless towers, fiber infrastructure and small cells, with \"edge\" data centers, as the planning for 5G wireless networks to support IoT (Internet of Things), autonomous vehicles, and smart cities evolves. However, one thing to keep in mind is that tower REITs typically receive 90% or more of revenues from the top three or four wireless carriers in each major market. This creates a tenant concentration risk which investors should be aware of, and monitor. MH: At the end of the day, data center and wireless/tower REITs are income investments. Which of these investments stand out? Which are ones to avoid? And can data center and wireless tower REITs continue to deliver income and growth to investors? Stoller: Great news. It pays to invest where real estate and technology intersect. Both the wireless tower and data center sector have delivered some of the highest total returns of all REITs during 2017. This follows on the heels of impressive 2016 results for data centers driven by revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins, and double-digit ROIC on capex allocated to new data centers and expansions. The industry tailwinds from growth in: wireless data, streaming media, cloud computing, distributed computing networks, big data and AI, and hybrid IT architecture (a mix of public, private/colo, and legacy data centers), should continue to drive outsized returns heading into 2018. Meanwhile, the wireless tower shared infrastructure business model delivers high margins when more than one carrier collocates equipment at a single site, or additional equipment is added. While there's always pushback from the major wireless carriers, this business model has proven to be highly predictable. There is no doubt that 5G will become a disruptive technology over the next few years. One area investors should carefully watch is how the evolving roll-out of 5G might impact cable and telecom ISPs. The deployment of modular, or micro \"edge\" data centers located near wireless towers to support low-latency IoT use cases like autonomous vehicles, is a key trend to watch. Blockchain is another evolving technology. Like the cloud, blockchain lives in data centers. As recently reported by Bloomberg, as more blockchain use cases evolve, (supported by heavyweights like IBM and others), this will become another driver for both data center growth and network traffic. MH: As for other REIT sectors, is retail an area to avoid, given the so-called Amazon impact on brick and mortar? Or are there a few retail REITs that could surprise to the upside? Stoller: Now that the initial results are in for a strong holiday selling season, retail REITs and many of the top retail names are leading returns for the month of December. As we head into 2018, I think that the narrative will change from \"retail apocalypse\" to omnichannel evolution. The business of being a landlord owning the proverbial \"best pins in the map\" is not going out of style, despite sensational media reports to the contrary. The best locations are being re-developed and \"densified\" into live/work/play mixed use development. Struggling department stores are being replaced by experiential retail concepts, food and beverage, entertainment, and online retailers beginning to plant the bricks and mortar seeds to expand their brand awareness. Notably, most industrial REITs - which benefit from the growth of e-commerce supply chains and third-party logistics for package delivery - traded at frothy valuations during 2017. In my view, the low-hanging fruit has already been picked as earnings multiples have expanded across the sector. Investors should be careful to guard against overpaying for these popular REITs. MH: How about healthcare REITs? Is this a sector to avoid given the murky regulatory and legislative atmosphere? Stoller: Healthcare REITs can be problematic, and we continue to be underweight this sector. In some cases, where HC REITs own and operate properties such as Seniors Housing, there are supply concerns due to overbuilding of new properties in several markets. This dynamic can put pressure on both occupancy and pricing. It can also create a competition for hiring on-site management and personnel, with higher wages hitting the expense side of the ledger. Some Skilled Nursing Home operators have been under investigation by regulators and required to pay substantial fines. Additionally, Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements have been capped or reduced, forcing some operators to negotiate reduced rental payments from REIT landlords directly, or through bankruptcy proceedings. Most HC REITs own the real estate and sign long-term leases with operators. In a rising rate environment, the payments from these \"bond-like\" triple-net leases may not increase fast enough to support attractive dividend growth. Blue-chips like Ventas (NYSE:VTR) that have strong balance sheets, and several operating platforms with strong management teams, can have an advantage. Stronger asset classes in healthcare real estate would include medical office buildings and life science facilities affiliated with hospitals and universities. Ventas can allocate capital to these stronger sectors where they already have scale and operating platforms. However, the demand for quality assets is high, making it a challenge to find accretive acquisitions. As of this writing, VTR shares are paying a quarterly distribution with an annual yield of 5.25%, which is attractive for a best-in-class REIT with a BBB+ rated balance sheet. I would expect Ventas to continue to raise its quarterly distribution by ~4% per year. MH: Other REIT sectors and/or stocks to explore or avoid? Stoller: Self-storage conjures images of metal buildings with roll-up doors painted in bright colors. On the surface it might appear to be an unsophisticated business. However, the publicly traded REITs that own institutional quality self-storage properties have a huge technology advantage vs. mom and pop operators that own most of this asset class. Unlike healthcare REITs with longer term leases, storage operators generally can raise rates on existing customers upon 30-day notification. The public REITs utilize sophisticated revenue management systems to maximize the growth of same-store NOI, which supports regular dividend growth. Third-party management is another source of fee income that can also provide a pipeline of potential acquisitions for the public REITs. During the past year, and continuing into 2018, a large supply of new storage properties came online in the top metro markets. This means that investors should do a bit of homework to understand the potential impact on individual self-storage REIT names going forward. Flipping back to data centers for a moment, global document and information storage giant Iron Mountain is a REIT that is diversifying into this higher growth business. However, another REIT, Corporate Office Property Trust (NYSE:OFC), an operator and developer of office and R&D facilities supporting mission-critical technology for government agencies, also has a data center component. COPT has a niche business developing powered shells for Amazon Web Services in Northern Virginia. The scale and growth of AWS in that market is mind boggling, where they lease dozens of data centers. These powered-shell buildings are usually excluded from net-absorption reports on this largest US data center market. There also are non-REIT publicly traded data center operators to consider: GDS Holdings mainland China, InterXion (NYSE:INXN) pan-European data centers, and recent US IPO Switch, Inc. (NYSE:SWCH), are three additional ways for investors to participate in the demand for data centers. MH: Data center REITs are off their 52-week highs. What gives? Stoller: Great question. During the past two years, data center REITs have delivered outstanding total returns for investors. No stock continues to stair-step up in price without a few pullbacks. The pattern since Q4 2015 has been for data center REIT price appreciation to take a breather twice a year. Data centers delivered huge gains during the first half of both 2016 and 2017, and tend to retrace a bit during summer. Additionally, they are subject to year-end profit taking and portfolio adjustments as they become a larger holding due to price appreciation. Investors often complain that data centers are \"too expensive.\" However, when you adjust for revenue growth and FFO/AFFO per share growth, this recession-proof sector can be bought on these retracements. Notably, long-term drivers for data center growth continue to provide sector tailwinds. One way to think about this is that global data doubles every 18 months to 24 months. This exponential growth in data remains totally agnostic to GDP growth, consumer confidence or employment statistics, which along with population growth, are the drivers for traditional REIT sectors. I discussed catalysts for growth in more detail in an SA Marketplace Roundtable interview earlier this year. We continue to opportunistically buy the dips, as each data center REIT hits our entry target or add/buy target. Going into 2018, Equinix remains one of our top picks for both total return and dividend growth. I discussed the rationale behind my bullish thesis on EQIX for SA readers a couple of months ago. Subsequent to the publication of that article, there have been opportunities to initiate positions at \"fair value\" for the entire data center sector.

And (this is a question I asked last year) why can't a giant like Amazon (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) or Google build and operate data center infrastructure on their own?</p> \n <p>Stoller: The hyperscale public cloud and software as a service (SaaS) giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\">IBM</a>) Cloud and Oracle Cloud, as well as social media giant Facebook, and tech giants like Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) tend to follow a dual strategy of owning and leasing data centers.</p> \n <p>In many cases, these large hyperscalers locate in third-party data centers to make it easier for customers to access their public cloud offerings, as part of a hybrid IT strategy. Secure and fast interconnection with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others can act as a magnet to draw in hundreds of SMB and enterprise data center customers. According to a recent industry report (which did not break out owned vs. leased):</p> \n <p>Notably, the exponential growth of cloud deployments can make it difficult to predict growth in any given market, (keeping in mind that high-performance applications must be located close to the eyeballs consuming them).</p> \n <p>Data center REITs have optimized supply chains, helping with a speed-to-market advantage that comes with owning entitled land, and/or an inventory of powered shell space, ready to build out.</p> \n <p>This is especially the case in higher barrier-to-entry markets like Silicon Valley and Chicago. It is a virtuous cycle, and the rate of public cloud adoption continues to be an important aspect of demand for both retail/colocation and wholesale data centers.</p> \n <p>One trend to watch is the purchase of land by Google and Facebook in Northern Virginia. Will they partner with developers, or choose to build their own data centers in the largest data center market in the world? If you own shares of FANG stocks, is it is because they own real estate? It is more than likely the ability to sell hardware profitably, and grow a global software business on a massive scale. On the other side of the coin, the enormous investment in sub-sea cable deployments helps the hyperscalers to control their own destiny.</p> \n <p>MH: What about acquisitions? Could we see some consolidation within the data center space?</p> \n <p>Stoller: There continues to be a tremendous amount of institutional capital and private equity looking to find a home in \"growthy\" data centers. This has resulted in a record year for data center M&amp;A transactions.</p> \n <p>In addition to the $7.8 billion DuPont Fabros merger, there were over a dozen other deals which closed during the year, including the Equinix $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\">VZ</a>) North and Latin America data center business, (previously announced in 2016).</p> \n <p>Other significant deals included: Peak 10's $1.7 billion purchase of Via West, Digital Bridge leading a $1 billion acquisition of Silicon Valley wholesale provider Vantage Data Centers; Cyxtera acquiring the Century Link (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTL\">CTL</a>) colocation data center portfolio for $1.86 billion (CTL retained a 10% ownership in Cyxtera). Iron Mountain (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM\">IRM</a>) followed up the $128 million acquisition of FORTRUST in Denver, and the pending $100 million sale-leaseback purchase of Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore, with a $1.3 billion announced acquisition of IO's US data center business. This was in addition to opening the first phase of its first major greenfield development in Northern Virginia.</p> \n <p>Equinix just announced a $792 million acquisition of 10 Metronode data centers located in Australia, to be purchased from Ontario Teachers Pension Fund. Equinix had previously announced a $93 million acquisition of a Zenium data center in Istanbul, Turkey.</p> \n <p>While this list is far from inclusive, it does mention many of the larger deals which total over $18 billion, anchoring the largest M&amp;A year for data centers. Back in January, <a href=\"http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2017/01/17/2016-record-data-center-m-2017-will-be-off-charts\">I predicted an active year for M&amp;A</a>, but the voracious appetite by both public and privately held buyers was totally off the charts in 2017. This slide from Digital Realty's Dec. 5, 2017 Investor Day presentation is more comprehensive, and shows how 2017 was truly an \"epic\" year when it came to data center deals.</p> \n <p>MH: How about wireless/tower REITs?</p> \n <p>Stoller: We closely cover wireless tower and fiber infrastructure, keeping an eye on American Tower (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMT\">AMT</a>), Crown Castle International (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCI\">CCI</a>) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBAC\">SBAC</a>). One of the big themes this year has been the confluence of wireless towers, fiber infrastructure and small cells, with \"edge\" data centers, as the planning for 5G wireless networks to support IoT (Internet of Things), autonomous vehicles, and smart cities evolves.</p> \n <p>However, one thing to keep in mind is that tower REITs typically receive 90% or more of revenues from the top three or four wireless carriers in each major market. This creates a tenant concentration risk which investors should be aware of, and monitor.</p> \n <p>MH: At the end of the day, data center and wireless/tower REITs are income investments. Which of these investments stand out? Which are ones to avoid? And can data center and wireless tower REITs continue to deliver income and growth to investors?</p> \n <p>Stoller: Great news. It pays to invest where real estate and technology intersect. Both the wireless tower and data center sector have delivered some of the highest total returns of all REITs during 2017.</p> \n <p>This follows on the heels of impressive 2016 results for data centers driven by revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins, and double-digit ROIC on capex allocated to new data centers and expansions. The industry tailwinds from growth in: wireless data, streaming media, cloud computing, distributed computing networks, big data and AI, and hybrid IT architecture (a mix of public, private/colo, and legacy data centers), should continue to drive outsized returns heading into 2018.</p> \n <p>Meanwhile, the wireless tower shared infrastructure business model delivers high margins when more than one carrier collocates equipment at a single site, or additional equipment is added.</p> \n <p>While there's always pushback from the major wireless carriers, this business model has proven to be highly predictable.</p> \n <p>There is no doubt that 5G will become a disruptive technology over the next few years. One area investors should carefully watch is how the evolving roll-out of 5G might impact cable and telecom ISPs. The deployment of modular, or micro \"edge\" data centers located near wireless towers to support low-latency IoT use cases like autonomous vehicles, is a key trend to watch.</p> \n <p>Blockchain is another evolving technology. Like the cloud, blockchain lives in data centers. As recently reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/blockchain-pumping-new-life-into-old-school-companies-like-ibm\">Bloomberg</a>, as more blockchain use cases evolve, (supported by heavyweights like IBM and others), this will become another driver for both data center growth and network traffic.</p> \n <p>MH: As for other REIT sectors, is retail an area to avoid, given the so-called Amazon impact on brick and mortar? Or are there a few retail REITs that could surprise to the upside?</p> \n <p>Stoller: Now that the initial results are in for a strong holiday selling season, retail REITs and many of the top retail names are leading returns for the month of December. As we head into 2018, I think that the narrative will change from \"retail apocalypse\" to omnichannel evolution. The business of being a landlord owning the proverbial \"best pins in the map\" is not going out of style, despite sensational media reports to the contrary.</p> \n <p>The best locations are being re-developed and \"densified\" into live/work/play mixed use development. Struggling department stores are being replaced by experiential retail concepts, food and beverage, entertainment, and online retailers beginning to plant the bricks and mortar seeds to expand their brand awareness.</p> \n <p>Notably, most industrial REITs - which benefit from the growth of e-commerce supply chains and third-party logistics for package delivery - traded at frothy valuations during 2017. In my view, the low-hanging fruit has already been picked as earnings multiples have expanded across the sector. Investors should be careful to guard against overpaying for these popular REITs.</p> \n <p>MH: How about healthcare REITs? Is this a sector to avoid given the murky regulatory and legislative atmosphere?</p> \n <p>Stoller: Healthcare REITs can be problematic, and we continue to be underweight this sector.</p> \n <p>In some cases, where HC REITs own and operate properties such as Seniors Housing, there are supply concerns due to overbuilding of new properties in several markets. This dynamic can put pressure on both occupancy and pricing. It can also create a competition for hiring on-site management and personnel, with higher wages hitting the expense side of the ledger.</p> \n <p>Some Skilled Nursing Home operators have been under investigation by regulators and required to pay substantial fines. Additionally, Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements have been capped or reduced, forcing some operators to negotiate reduced rental payments from REIT landlords directly, or through bankruptcy proceedings. Most HC REITs own the real estate and sign long-term leases with operators. In a rising rate environment, the payments from these \"bond-like\" triple-net leases may not increase fast enough to support attractive dividend growth.</p> \n <p>Blue-chips like Ventas (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTR\">VTR</a>) that have strong balance sheets, and several operating platforms with strong management teams, can have an advantage. Stronger asset classes in healthcare real estate would include medical office buildings and life science facilities affiliated with hospitals and universities. Ventas can allocate capital to these stronger sectors where they already have scale and operating platforms. However, the demand for quality assets is high, making it a challenge to find accretive acquisitions.</p> \n <p>As of this writing, VTR shares are paying a quarterly distribution with an annual yield of 5.25%, which is attractive for a best-in-class REIT with a BBB+ rated balance sheet. I would expect Ventas to continue to raise its quarterly distribution by ~4% per year.</p> \n <p>MH: Other REIT sectors and/or stocks to explore or avoid?</p> \n <p>Stoller: Self-storage conjures images of metal buildings with roll-up doors painted in bright colors. On the surface it might appear to be an unsophisticated business. However, the publicly traded REITs that own institutional quality self-storage properties have a huge technology advantage vs. mom and pop operators that own most of this asset class.</p> \n <p>Unlike healthcare REITs with longer term leases, storage operators generally can raise rates on existing customers upon 30-day notification. The public REITs utilize sophisticated revenue management systems to maximize the growth of same-store NOI, which supports regular dividend growth. Third-party management is another source of fee income that can also provide a pipeline of potential acquisitions for the public REITs.</p> \n <p>During the past year, and continuing into 2018, a large supply of new storage properties came online in the top metro markets. This means that investors should do a bit of homework to understand the potential impact on individual self-storage REIT names going forward.</p> \n <p>Flipping back to data centers for a moment, global document and information storage giant Iron Mountain is a REIT that is diversifying into this higher growth business. However, another REIT, Corporate Office Property Trust (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OFC\">OFC</a>), an operator and developer of office and R&amp;D facilities supporting mission-critical technology for government agencies, also has a data center component. COPT has a niche business developing powered shells for Amazon Web Services in Northern Virginia. The scale and growth of AWS in that market is mind boggling, where they lease dozens of data centers. These powered-shell buildings are usually excluded from net-absorption reports on this largest US data center market.</p> \n <p>There also are non-REIT publicly traded data center operators to consider: GDS Holdings mainland China, InterXion (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INXN\">INXN</a>) pan-European data centers, and recent US IPO Switch, Inc. (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWCH\">SWCH</a>), are three additional ways for investors to participate in the demand for data centers.</p> \n <p>MH: Data center REITs are off their 52-week highs. What gives?</p> \n <p>Stoller: Great question. During the past two years, data center REITs have delivered outstanding total returns for investors. No stock continues to stair-step up in price without a few pullbacks.</p> \n <p>The pattern since Q4 2015 has been for data center REIT price appreciation to take a breather twice a year. Data centers delivered huge gains during the first half of both 2016 and 2017, and tend to retrace a bit during summer. Additionally, they are subject to year-end profit taking and portfolio adjustments as they become a larger holding due to price appreciation.</p> \n <p>Investors often complain that data centers are \"too expensive.\" However, when you adjust for revenue growth and FFO/AFFO per share growth, this recession-proof sector can be bought on these retracements. Notably, long-term drivers for data center growth continue to provide sector tailwinds.</p> \n <p>One way to think about this is that global data doubles every 18 months to 24 months. This exponential growth in data remains totally agnostic to GDP growth, consumer confidence or employment statistics, which along with population growth, are the drivers for traditional REIT sectors. I discussed catalysts for growth in more detail in an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4059392-marketplace-roundtable-journey-center-data-bill-stoller\">SA Marketplace Roundtable</a> interview earlier this year.</p> \n <p>We continue to opportunistically buy the dips, as each data center REIT hits our entry target or add/buy target. Going into 2018, Equinix remains one of our top picks for both total return and dividend growth. I discussed the rationale behind my bullish thesis on EQIX for SA readers a couple of months ago. Subsequent to the publication of that article, there have been opportunities to initiate positions at \"fair value\" for the entire data center sector.</p> \n <p>My premium research is found on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bill-stoller/research\">REITs 4 Alpha: High-Yield | DGI | Technology</a> on SA&amp;'s Marketplace.

Reducing the statutory corporate rate from over 30% to around 20%, the tax bill is meant to reduce the tax \"burden\" faced by companies, especially those with large overseas profits. This is due to the repatriation provision, which in short states that foreign cash can be repatriated at a one-time cost of 8% for profits invested in real estate, and 15.5% for profits in cash and stock. When Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook famously donated lavishly to Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, people wondered what the two could ever have in common politically. Now, we know: taxes.

Now, we can begin to flesh out the details of how Apple stands to benefit, and what it can do with all the cash. Here is a clip of myself discussing the tax bill on SA partner Cheddar TV. A recent Bank of America Merril Lynch survey might be a good starting point. The survey polled 300 S&P companies on what they would do with repatriated foreign cash: The top response should be no surprise: US corporations intend to pay down debt. This debt was issued largely because of two reasons. The first, since the great recession, interest rates have been rock bottom. It made good financial sense to issue debt at 1-2%.

So a bit of a no-brainer, whatever your opinion on tax avoidance. Apple's own balance sheet exploded with debt because of these very reasons, going from nearly $0 in 2011-2012 to almost $100bn today. Quite a jump in five years, especially for a company with a record cash treasure chest. Gene Munster came out with his own predictions too, saying that Apple will bring back around $215bn. According to Munster, Apple will only marginally increase its quarterly dividend by 15% from its typical 10% yearly increase. However, we believe the Apple is primed for a strong acquisition and a one-time special dividend. Remember, executives at Apple making these decisions, like CEO Tim Cook, hold millions of shares of Apple, and they are almost certain to line their own pockets, even as other shareholders stand to gain as well. Next, as Apple continues its push into original content, we believe a media acquisition is also waiting in the wings.

Two days later, while Qualcomm was still considering the Broadcom bid, Qualcomm announced the first \u201ccommercial shipment\u201d of its Centriq 2400 series ARM server processor. On November 13, Qualcomm's Board unanimously rejected the Broadcom proposal. All three events were in fact tightly coupled. Broadcom had recognized the opportunity presented by Qualcomm's entry into the server market, and hoped to capitalize on it. Probably, it's already too late. It's been my general belief that ARM architecture would eventually supplant Intel x86 in the datacenter, based on cost competitiveness and energy efficiency. The fundamental advantage of cost competitiveness had already been demonstrated in Intel's (INTC) failed attempt to take over the tablet market with its highly subsidized Atom processors. But it remained for a company to step up to the challenge of designing a purpose-built ARM architecture server processor on a competitive node and with performance to match Intel Xeon. With a series of real-world benchmarks by a global web hosting service, we have the first independent confirmation that Qualcomm has succeeded. These benchmarks were performed by an engineer with the hosting service Cloudflare and summarized in a blog piece. In the benchmark testing, a single socket 46 core Qualcomm Centriq 2452 which lists for $1,373 was compared with a dual socket server system featuring a pair of Xeon Silver 4116 Skylake processors. According to Intel, these list for $1,002 apiece. In most tests, Intel chips offered better single core performance, while the Centriq with its \u201cFalkor\u201d CPU cores performed better in \u201call core\u201d tests, as in this example of Gzip compression: Centriq didn't perform equally well in all benchmarks, of course, but where Centriq really stood out was in power efficiency. Cloudflare measured power consumption by setting up equivalent web server workloads using NGINX. Performance was measured in web server processed requests/second and CPU power consumption was monitored using on-board server diagnostics. Cloudflare found that Centriq was about twice as efficient as Intel. The ARM foundries have essentially equaled or slightly bettered Intel's 14 nm process this year with the 10 nm processes now available, and which Qualcomm is using for Centriq. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is the fabricator for Centriq. With the roll out of 7 nm processes planned for 2018, the foundries will likely pull ahead of Intel at least for servers, since it's unlikely that Intel will be able to offer 10 nm server chips until 2019. By erasing Intel's process lead, makers of ARM chips can leverage the fundamental advantage that ARM architecture has in terms of area efficiency. Generally, equal performance ARM chips are smaller than their Intel counterparts. This translates into both a cost and energy efficiency advantage. Source: Qualcomm ARM architecture appears poised not only to make inroads in the data center, but in the entire spectrum of computing needs in personal computers, laptops, and tablets. Most of the important ARM processor designers such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Qualcomm have been moving their mobile processor performance into Intel Core territory for some time. There's no reason why Qualcomm could not develop lower core count off-shoots of Centriq for Windows or Mac PCs. And Qualcomm already has its foot in the Windows door with its partnership with Microsoft for Mobile PCs. In short, I see Qualcomm poised to become the next Intel of computing. In many ways, it's better positioned than Intel, by virtue of its dominant presence in Android mobile devices. The above Tech Briefs are excerpts from a longer report published exclusively for Rethink Technology subscribers. Qualcomm is part of the Rethink Technology Portfolio and is a recommended buy. The high end of the smartphone market has become increasingly dominated by what I call new paradigm mobile device makers such as Apple and Samsung. These companies custom design their own processors and have them fabricated by a foundry like TSMC (TSM) rather than buy commodity chips as in the old paradigm PC model. But the upper mid tier and down still operates according to the old paradigm, and here, Qualcomm is the dominant processor supplier. If you're a mid tier smartphone maker such as HTC, LG or even Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), there really is no better option than the Snapdragon 835. Qualcomm's position has become even stronger this month with a credible report that Mediatek intends to withdraw from so called \u201cflagship\u201d processors. This is the very top tier of smartphone processors and besides the 835 includes the Apple A11, Samsung Exynos 8895, Huawei Kirin 970 and Mediatek's Helio X30. The report comes from Gearburn, which interviewed Mediatek's general manager for international sales, Finbarr Moynihan. Moynihan's admissions to Gearburn paint a stark picture of the tough competition at the high end: Apparently, Mediatek's customers knew that as well, and Meizu was one of the few brands to use the chip. When asked if Mediatek was giving up on the flagship category, Moynihan replied, This amounts to face saving. The reality is that taking a couple of years break is fatal in this business. At this point, Qualcomm's competition as a commodity chip supplier in the Android world is diminished, since Samsung and Huawei mainly use their processors in their own branded phones.", "publishDate": "2017-11-28T01:52:16", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>Rethink Technology business briefs for November 27, 2017</p> \n <p>Source: Qualcomm</p> \n <p>On November 6, Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\">AVGO</a>) formally proposed its acquisition of Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\">QCOM</a>) for a per share consideration of $60 cash and $10.00 of Broadcom stock.

The fundamental advantage of cost competitiveness had already been demonstrated in Intel's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\">INTC</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3813196-intels-mobile-device-capitulation?source=all_articles_title\">failed attempt</a> to take over the tablet market with its highly subsidized Atom processors.</p> \n <p>But it remained for a company to step up to the challenge of designing a purpose-built ARM architecture server processor on a competitive node and with performance to match Intel Xeon. With a series of real-world benchmarks by a global web hosting service, we have the first independent confirmation that Qualcomm has succeeded.</p> \n <p>These benchmarks were performed by an engineer with the hosting service Cloudflare and summarized in a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/arm-takes-wing/\">blog piece</a>. In the benchmark testing, a single socket 46 core Qualcomm Centriq 2452 which <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/795-supercomputing-2017-in-pictures.html#s11\">lists</a> for $1,373 was compared with a dual socket server system featuring a pair of Xeon Silver 4116 Skylake processors. <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/products/120481/Intel-Xeon-Silver-4116-Processor-16_5M-Cache-2_10-GHz\">According</a> to Intel, these list for $1,002 apiece.</p> \n <p>In most tests, Intel chips offered better single core performance, while the Centriq with its \u201cFalkor\u201d CPU cores performed better in \u201call core\u201d tests, as in this example of Gzip compression:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Centriq didn't perform equally well in all benchmarks, of course, but where Centriq really stood out was in power efficiency. Cloudflare measured power consumption by setting up equivalent web server workloads using <a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/\">NGINX</a>. Performance was measured in web server processed requests/second and CPU power consumption was monitored using on-board server diagnostics. Cloudflare found that Centriq was about twice as efficient as Intel.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The ARM foundries have essentially equaled or slightly bettered Intel's 14 nm process this year with the 10 nm processes now available, and which Qualcomm is using for Centriq. Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\">OTC:SSNLF</a>) is the fabricator for Centriq. With the roll out of 7 nm processes planned for 2018, the foundries will likely pull ahead of Intel at least for servers, since it's unlikely that Intel will be able to offer 10 nm server chips until 2019.</p> \n <p>By erasing Intel's process lead, makers of ARM chips can leverage the fundamental advantage that ARM architecture has in terms of area efficiency. Generally, equal performance ARM chips are smaller than their Intel counterparts. This translates into both a cost and energy efficiency advantage.</p> \n <p>Source: Qualcomm</p> \n <p>ARM architecture appears poised not only to make inroads in the data center, but in the entire spectrum of computing needs in personal computers, laptops, and tablets. Most of the important ARM processor designers such as Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>), Samsung and Qualcomm have been moving their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4125318-apple-silicon-unforgiving\">mobile processor performance</a> into Intel Core territory for some time.</p> \n <p>There's no reason why Qualcomm could not develop lower core count off-shoots of Centriq for Windows or Mac PCs. And Qualcomm already has its foot in the Windows door with its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029920-microsoft-makes-statement-future-mobile-computing\">partnership with Microsoft</a> for Mobile PCs.</p> \n <p>In short, I see Qualcomm poised to become the next Intel of computing. In many ways, it's better positioned than Intel, by virtue of its dominant presence in Android mobile devices.</p> \n <p>The above Tech Briefs are excerpts from a longer <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/research/6965821-mark-hibben/5076051-qualcomm-right-reject-broadcoms-bid\">report</a> published exclusively for Rethink Technology subscribers.</p> \n <p>Qualcomm is part of the Rethink Technology Portfolio and is a recommended buy.</p> \n <p>The high end of the smartphone market has become increasingly dominated by what I call new paradigm mobile device makers such as Apple and Samsung. These companies custom design their own processors and have them fabricated by a foundry like TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\">TSM</a>) rather than buy commodity chips as in the old paradigm PC model.</p> \n <p>But the upper mid tier and down still operates according to the old paradigm, and here, Qualcomm is the dominant processor supplier. If you're a mid tier smartphone maker such as HTC, LG or even Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\">GOOGL</a>), there really is no better option than the Snapdragon 835.</p> \n <p>Qualcomm's position has become even stronger this month with a credible report that Mediatek intends to withdraw from so called \u201cflagship\u201d processors. This is the very top tier of smartphone processors and besides the 835 includes the Apple A11, Samsung Exynos 8895, Huawei Kirin 970 and Mediatek's Helio X30.</p> \n <p>The <a href=\"https://gearburn.com/2017/11/mediatek-break-flagship-chips/\">report</a> comes from Gearburn, which interviewed Mediatek's general manager for international sales, Finbarr Moynihan. Moynihan's admissions to Gearburn paint a stark picture of the tough competition at the high end:</p> \n <p>Apparently, Mediatek's customers knew that as well, and Meizu was one of the few brands to use the chip. When asked if Mediatek was giving up on the flagship category, Moynihan replied,</p> \n <p>This amounts to face saving. The reality is that taking a couple of years break is fatal in this business. At this point, Qualcomm's competition as a commodity chip supplier in the Android world is diminished, since Samsung and Huawei mainly use their processors in their own branded phones.</p> \n</div>", "score": 15.78795, "discoverDate": "2017-11-28T02:21:35.278+0000", "highlight": " designers such as Apple (<highlighted>AAPL</highlighted>), Samsung and Qualcomm have been moving their mobile processor performance", "id": "iK3cjL8UDkldkugxRK-SGpB3_5GRp68KL5lQq7L07z0xDVwmoIS-tni-iMvLu1i8_jrYNgDTh19xYQH85oriRA", "metadata": {"finSentiment": {"type": "finSentiment", "sentiment": 0.02}, "readTime": {"seconds": 209, "type": "readTime"}}}, {"website": {"name": "staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/", "countryCode": "", "domainName": "seekingalpha.com", "region": null, "hostName": "seekingalpha.com", "countryName": "", "iconURL": "https://staticseekingalpha2.a.ssl.fastly.net/assets/favicon-a2c6a902a7244e473d37b199d3051bcd31bce6384495593c944f72160559ceb9.svg"}, "elements": [{"title": null, "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/26/36835796-1511709677980707.png", "primary": true, "height": null, "width": null, "alternative": null, "type": "Image"}], "language": "en", "title": "Apple: Valuation Update After Quarterly Results", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4127784-apple-valuation-update-quarterly-results", "text": "Apple is extremely overrated in terms of analysis of Price/Earnings to Growth and Price/Sales to Growth multiples. Three different approaches to evaluating Apple (AAPL) do not indicate rapid and stable growth of the company's market price in the near future. If asked which value driver has the greatest impact on multiples, analysts and investors are likely to answer 'growth'. The problem is that Apple is now extremely overpriced in the context of growth rate. It is almost meaningless to compare Apple with other companies directly through the multiples. Firstly because, probably except for Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has virtually no close competitors among the public companies. And secondly, the phase of Apple life cycle also has few analogs. So, if we want to compare Apple's multiples, they should first be adjusted to the pace of growth. The most suitable multiples for this purpose, in my opinion, are Price/Earnings to Growth and Price/Sales to Growth. In this case, in order to calculate them, I used not the actual indicators of earnings and revenues, but the predictable ones. Thus, the obtained multiples represent the ratio of P/E Forward and P/S Forward to the expected profit and revenue growth. For comparison, I chose the companies from the list - FAAMG and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). And here's what I've got: As you can see, the result of Apple turned out to be the highest in both multiples, which means the maximum balanced price of its shares does not exceed $123. Let's move on and look at how the growth of Apple's financial indicators relate to the current level of its multiples. Let's start with EPS and P/E growth rates. In the calendar Q3, the three-year CAGR EPS (ttm) diluted amounted to 12,68% - this is the second worst result of Apple over the past ten years. And at the same time, the current P/E multiple is the highest since the year 2008. This is an apparent inconsistency indicating the reassessment of the company. The situation with EBITDA is approximately the same. A four-year CAGR of this indicator in the last quarter rose to 7,63%, which is very close to the historical minimum values. However, EV/EBITDA is at the level of the year, when the four-year CAGR of EBITDA amounted to more than 60%: Finally, the growth rate of Apple's OpFCF in the last quarter was the second worst in the history of the company, and EV/OpFCF multiple rose to the maximum, recorded over the last 7 years: As we can see, in terms of growth of EPS, EBITDA and OpFCF, the market has been chronically overestimating Apple in the last few years. Now let's see what the DCF analysis says about the fair price of Apple. In July, I described in detail the building of my DCF-model for Apple based on the prospects of the global smartphone market. In this article, I will update these calculations. First of all, it is worth noting that the results of the last quarter and the release of the new line of Apple products raised the expectations regarding the future revenue of the company. Here's what they were like in July: Here's what they look like now. Accordingly, I had to adjust Apple's revenue predictions for the next 10 years: Here is the actual WACC calculation: Note that the current 1-y Beta Coefficient of Apple is 1,26, which is very close to the historical maximum of the year 2005. The bigger beta means greater systematic risk which is negative for the company and indicates high short-term speculative interest in the shares of the company. I assume that Apple's operating margin will gradually decrease to the level of 23% due to the increased competition: AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Here's the model itself: The DCF-based target price of Apple's shares is $199, offering 14% upside. Thus, Apple is overvalued in two out of three analyses, and the result of only one analysis gives more or less fair price estimation. I perfectly understand that Apple's dividend policy and the generous buyback program provide a good support for shares. However, in my opinion, the chronically over-the-top multiples amid record-low growth rates of Apple's key financial indicators are not the best combination for shares in wait for rapid and stable growth.

When you see large single day gains associated with M&A premiums when offers are made, it\u2019s easy to get excited and buy into unrealistic expectations of riches and grandeur. When you\u2019re a DGI investor and you typically own large cap stocks, it\u2019s rare to see double digit daily moves. What\u2019s more, when two large cap companies attempt to merge it dominates the market related headlines, causing eyeballs that might not otherwise pay much attention to a certain industry/sector to take notice. Oftentimes, these new eyeballs are very short sighted and bring opinions with them that reek with ignorance and speculation. Investors who owned these names previously cannot let themselves buy into the hype. Instead, they must stay disciplined and stick to their fundamental valuation models that got them there in the first place. When M&A negotiations are underway, sometimes offers are raised, padding investor pockets with cash, and sometimes, deals fall through, leaving them holding an empty bag. Without a working crystal ball, investors have no way of knowing just how M&A will turn out. And since no one that I know of has one of those, I think that investors must focus on fundamentals because these numbers are the only objective, tangible information that we have to trade off of during highly speculative times that surround M&A activity. A couple of recent examples of this, on both ends of the sell/hold spectrum, within my portfolio were Unilever (UL) and Time Warner Inc (TWX). When Kraft Heinz (KHC) attempted to buy Unilever earlier in the year, UL stock shot up in anticipation on the deal. I was long UL prior to the rumors beginning and although I liked seeing the ~10% bump in share price, I didn\u2019t sell my shares because I believed that UL was the best in class consumer staples company and was still priced cheaper than its peers. Even though a lot of the margin of safety I saw in UL\u2019s late in 2016 when I bought shares at $40.30 was diminished as the M&A premium was priced into shares, I still thought they were trading at fair value in the low $50\u2019s due to UL\u2019s future growth expectations. Holding on to these shares and not selling out on the buyout rumors turned out to be a good idea because since KHC\u2019s bid failed, UL\u2019s stock has continued to rise because of these improving fundamentals. I did sell my TWX position as its M&A premium pushed the valuation on shares past what I was willing to pay for a media company in today\u2019s market. I bought a couple of lots of TWX shares, both before and after AT&T agreed to acquire the company last year, when they were trading in the ~14x range. Sure, there are other media companies on the market that were cheaper than that; however, I thought that was a fair price to pay for TWX due to its strong assets, fundamental growth trajectories, and generous shareholder return policies. ~13x has been a strong support level for TWX over the past 7 years or so, meaning that I felt comfortable that my downside was limited in the 14x range. However, when TWX shares approached and surpassed the $100 range a few months ago (drastically closing the arb spread from more than 20% when I bought to them to less than 5% with regard to AT&T\u2019s proposed buyout in the $107 range), I knew my downside was significantly more than my remaining upside since the deal was already agreed upon. I knew T wouldn\u2019t be raising the price (I didn\u2019t expect TWX to choose to incur the large breakup fee by attempting to merge with another suitor). I expected that TWX would trade down to the mid-lower $80\u2019s should the deal fall through, meaning my risk was ~20% to the downside. What\u2019s more, at ~$100/share, TWX was no longer trading at the ~14x fair value that I targeted when buying shares. Once the M&A premium was priced in, TWX was valued at ~16.5x 2017 expectations, meaning that TWX shares were trading somewhat in-line with Disney (DIS) shares without the moat offered by the much broader diversification that Disney offers investors in the media space. I sold my TWX position at $99.05 and $102.61, locking is solid gains due to the M&A premium. Because the risk/reward was no longer in my favor, I knew that I shouldn\u2019t get greedy, hoping to eek out another ~5% or so of gains on an already very successful trade. When I sold these shares I had no idea that the DOJ would sue AT&T over the deal, causing TWX shares to plummet back down to the mid $80\u2019s. I recently added TWX back to my portfolio because of the value that the shares offered below $90 and I hope to ride them back up to the ~$100 range. This example just goes to show that investors can do well in volatile markets by focusing on the fundamentals while many swing traders are riding momentum up or down, speculatively. All of this leads me to Qualcomm (QCOM), which has been on a strong run-up as of late because of Broadcom\u2019s (AVGO) attempted purchase of the company. And now, as a QCOM shareholder, I must decide whether or not to cash in my chips, which are worth a lot more today than they were a few weeks back due to AVGO\u2019s offer, or to attempt to ride out what is likely to be a volatile, speculative roller coaster, as both sides attempt to find middle ground here with regards to a takeover price. I owned both QCOM and AVGO prior to the buyout news breaking and I\u2019m bullish on both long-term. I was actually lucky enough to add to my AVGO stake just days prior to the QCOM offer being announced. I bought shares during the press conference in which President Trump touted AVGO CEO Hock Tan the latter\u2019s plans to re-domicile his company back to America from Singapore. I had a feeling that were might be more to this story than a more competitive tax environment being proposed in the GOP\u2019s tax reform plans, and it turned out I was right. Whether it\u2019s right or wrong with regard to ant-trust law/regulation, garnering favor from this \u201cAmerica first\u201d administration will certainly go a long way towards helping a mega-deal like the AVGO/QCOM merger go through. I have no plans to sell my AVGO. I think this is a long-term growth story and prior to this merger news, I suspected that AVGO would be one of the most impressive,dividend growth companies in the market, if not the most impressive, over the coming years. AVGO is highly profitable and has a habit of implementing very shareholder friendly maneuvers. This company increased its shareholder dividend by 100% last year and I was expecting another very significant increase this December as well. The attempted QCOM purchase has tempered my expectation in this regard. Surely, AVGO won\u2019t put undue pressure on its balance sheet with a large dividend increase alongside a $100b acquisition. In the short term, this is disappointing to me as a DGI investor; however, assuming the deal goes through, AVGO/QCOM will be a powerhouse in the semiconductor space and I look forward to owning an outsized position. I am however considering selling my QCOM stake. I\u2019ve seen several noted SA contributors chime in on this issue of late and now that QCOM\u2019s share price is approaching $70, it\u2019s my turn to throw my hat into the ring. Due primarily to issues in its highly profitable QTL segment, QCOM\u2019s earnings outlook is bleak moving forward. QCOM\u2019s bottom line has really suffered thus far in 2017 as the company attempts to resolve legal issues with Apple (AAPL) as well as other foreign entities. Technology sales were up 7% on the year for QCOM; however, licensing sales were down 16% because of ongoing royalty disputes. Both QCOM and AAPL seem to have dug in their heels with regard to this issue and I don\u2019t see it going away anytime soon. QCOM has some of the world\u2019s best patent related lawyers and it has a successful history of defending its business model, but then again, AAPL is no slouch. I think it\u2019s speculative, at best, to pick a winner right now. I also think it\u2019s speculative to assume which company, QCOM or AAPL, needs the other one most to succeed moving forward. All of this speculation played a large role in driving down QCOM\u2019s share price to the low $50\u2019s where it was trading before AVGO came in with its $70 offer (the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty). Investors need to keep this in mind when throwing around takeover target prices in the $80, $90, and even $100 range. Without this AVGO deal, I suspect QCOM\u2019s share price would still be languishing in the royalty dispute gutter. That's especially given even more uncertainty still surrounding QCOM\u2019s NXPI acquisition, which is what many QCOM investors (including myself) have hung their future growth hats on for this company. Because of QCOM\u2019s bottom line issues, the company is trading at levels today that it hasn't seen since early 2013. If you believe that the bottom line woes relating to the royalty disputes are going to be short-lived, then this isn\u2019t exactly an apples to apples comparison. However, like I said above, I see no reason to believe that QCOM\u2019s QTL sales/earnings are going to shoot back up to previous levels in the short-term, at least. On a forward basis, QCOM is trading for nearly 20x its 2018 average analyst EPS expectation of $3.54, which is significantly lower than the $4.28 it posted in 2017 (it\u2019s worth noting that this $4.28 EPS figure is non-GAAP, QCOM\u2019s 2017 GAAP earnings were just $1.65). 20x is a steep price to pay for a company in this space; Intel (INTC), which has been posting solid growth as of late, is trading for less than 14x its forward EPS estimates. I see little margin of safety left in my QCOM shares, and that is causing me to strongly consider selling (or at the very least, trimming my position) and locking in gains. What\u2019s more, the AVGO news has pushed QCOM out of the red and into the black for me. I was content holding (and adding to) my depressed QCOM stake due to its low valuation and its very high dividend yield is the $50\u2019s, but now that the company is trading for ~$70, I think that AVGO might be offering me a nice opportunity to transition out of a company that has been a dog for me at a profit. The biggest issue that I have with selling my QCOM shares in the income that I would lose. QCOM pays what I believe to be a relatively safe, high dividend yield. My yield on cost is 3.7% and even after the company\u2019s recent run-up, shares are still yielding a strong 3.3%. Although I suspect QCOM\u2019s dividend growth will slow in the near future because of the aforementioned QTL issues that are hurting profits, QCOM has been a very strong dividend growth play for income oriented investors in the recent past and it\u2019s difficult for me to part ways with shares when management has proven itself to be so generous to shareholders. With that said, QCOM\u2019s recent share price gains are equivalent to more than 8 years worth of dividend payments at the current annual rate and it\u2019s not as if I couldn\u2019t find another company with a similar yield/dividend growth prospects at a cheaper valuation in today\u2019s market. I haven\u2019t made a move yet with regard to my QCOM stake, but the more I think about it, I\u2019m leaning towards selling/trimming my stake in the near future. Really, it just comes down to the old saying, \u201cpigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.\u201d I\u2019ve been a pig thus far, watching as QCOM\u2019s share price rose to meet AVGO\u2019s current offer, but I don\u2019t necessarily want to push my luck hoping for higher bids moving forward. I\u2019ve been waiting to sell, because usually, when you\u2019re negotiating, you don\u2019t open up with your best offer. I suspect that AVGO is willing to go higher and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see official word of an increased offer coming soon. With that said, I\u2019m putting my invested capital at risk waiting for a new bid and due to valuation issues with QCOM at these ~$70 prices, I think my upside is dwarfed by my downside, in the near-term, at least. Like I said before, in times like this, you\u2019ll see all sorts of egregious claims regarding how much money the shares of a company might be worth. I\u2019ve seen many people saying that they wouldn\u2019t part ways with their QCOM stock for less than $100/share and I caution investors not to buy into these pie in the sky type of claims, but to instead, focus on the fundamentals. QCOM would be trading for nearly 30x 2018 EPS expectations at $100. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it, but the way I see it, there is no way that this company is worth that much. Will AVGO eventually take QCOM out in the $80-85 range? Maybe. If so, I\u2019d be leaving 15-20% on upside left on the table if I sold in the $70 range. However, it\u2019s also possible that the deal falls through and QCOM shares head back towards $50, or below even. Only time will tell, but in the meantime, I\u2019m going to do my best to be grateful for the opportunities that I have in front of me in the present and not get greedy.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.", "publishDate": "2017-11-27T08:05:31", "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>To me, a large part of being a successful investor in M&amp;A situation is being able to eliminate greed from the equation. When you see large single day gains associated with M&amp;A premiums when offers are made, it\u2019s easy to get excited and buy into unrealistic expectations of riches and grandeur. When you\u2019re a DGI investor and you typically own large cap stocks, it\u2019s rare to see double digit daily moves. What\u2019s more, when two large cap companies attempt to merge it dominates the market related headlines, causing eyeballs that might not otherwise pay much attention to a certain industry/sector to take notice. Oftentimes, these new eyeballs are very short sighted and bring opinions with them that reek with ignorance and speculation. Investors who owned these names previously cannot let themselves buy into the hype. Instead, they must stay disciplined and stick to their fundamental valuation models that got them there in the first place.</p> \n <p>When M&amp;A negotiations are underway, sometimes offers are raised, padding investor pockets with cash, and sometimes, deals fall through, leaving them holding an empty bag. Without a working crystal ball, investors have no way of knowing just how M&amp;A will turn out. And since no one that I know of has one of those, I think that investors must focus on fundamentals because these numbers are the only objective, tangible information that we have to trade off of during highly speculative times that surround M&amp;A activity.</p> \n <p>A couple of recent examples of this, on both ends of the sell/hold spectrum, within my portfolio were Unilever (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL\">UL</a>) and Time Warner Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWX\">TWX</a>).</p> \n <p>When Kraft Heinz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC\">KHC</a>) attempted to buy Unilever earlier in the year, UL stock shot up in anticipation on the deal. I was long UL prior to the rumors beginning and although I liked seeing the ~10% bump in share price, I didn\u2019t sell my shares because I believed that UL was the best in class consumer staples company and was still priced cheaper than its peers. Even though a lot of the margin of safety I saw in UL\u2019s late in 2016 when I bought shares at $40.30 was diminished as the M&amp;A premium was priced into shares, I still thought they were trading at fair value in the low $50\u2019s due to UL\u2019s future growth expectations. Holding on to these shares and not selling out on the buyout rumors turned out to be a good idea because since KHC\u2019s bid failed, UL\u2019s stock has continued to rise because of these improving fundamentals.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>I did sell my TWX position as its M&amp;A premium pushed the valuation on shares past what I was willing to pay for a media company in today\u2019s market. I bought a couple of lots of TWX shares, both before and after AT&amp;T agreed to acquire the company last year, when they were trading in the ~14x range. Sure, there are other media companies on the market that were cheaper than that; however, I thought that was a fair price to pay for TWX due to its strong assets, fundamental growth trajectories, and generous shareholder return policies. ~13x has been a strong support level for TWX over the past 7 years or so, meaning that I felt comfortable that my downside was limited in the 14x range.</p> \n <p>However, when TWX shares approached and surpassed the $100 range a few months ago (drastically closing the arb spread from more than 20% when I bought to them to less than 5% with regard to AT&amp;T\u2019s proposed buyout in the $107 range), I knew my downside was significantly more than my remaining upside since the deal was already agreed upon. I knew T wouldn\u2019t be raising the price (I didn\u2019t expect TWX to choose to incur the large breakup fee by attempting to merge with another suitor). I expected that TWX would trade down to the mid-lower $80\u2019s should the deal fall through, meaning my risk was ~20% to the downside.</p> \n <p>What\u2019s more, at ~$100/share, TWX was no longer trading at the ~14x fair value that I targeted when buying shares. Once the M&amp;A premium was priced in, TWX was valued at ~16.5x 2017 expectations, meaning that TWX shares were trading somewhat in-line with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\">DIS</a>) shares without the moat offered by the much broader diversification that Disney offers investors in the media space.</p> \n <p>I sold my TWX position at $99.05 and $102.61, locking is solid gains due to the M&amp;A premium. Because the risk/reward was no longer in my favor, I knew that I shouldn\u2019t get greedy, hoping to eek out another ~5% or so of gains on an already very successful trade. When I sold these shares I had no idea that the DOJ would sue AT&amp;T over the deal, causing TWX shares to plummet back down to the mid $80\u2019s. I recently added TWX back to my portfolio because of the value that the shares offered below $90 and I hope to ride them back up to the ~$100 range. This example just goes to show that investors can do well in volatile markets by focusing on the fundamentals while many swing traders are riding momentum up or down, speculatively.</p> \n <p>All of this leads me to Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\">QCOM</a>), which has been on a strong run-up as of late because of Broadcom\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\">AVGO</a>) <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-03/broadcom-is-said-to-explore-deal-to-acquire-chipmaker-qualcomm-j9k6u92n\">attempted purchase</a> of the company. And now, as a QCOM shareholder, I must decide whether or not to cash in my chips, which are worth a lot more today than they were a few weeks back due to AVGO\u2019s offer, or to attempt to ride out what is likely to be a volatile, speculative roller coaster, as both sides attempt to find middle ground here with regards to a takeover price.</p> \n <p>I owned both QCOM and AVGO prior to the buyout news breaking and I\u2019m bullish on both long-term. I was actually lucky enough to add to my AVGO stake just days prior to the QCOM offer being announced. I bought shares during the press conference in which President Trump touted AVGO CEO Hock Tan the latter\u2019s plans to <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/broadcom-limited-announces-intention-to-redomicile-in-the-united-states-20171102-01648\">re-domicile his company</a> back to America from Singapore. I had a feeling that were might be more to this story than a more competitive tax environment being proposed in the GOP\u2019s tax reform plans, and it turned out I was right. Whether it\u2019s right or wrong with regard to ant-trust law/regulation, garnering favor from this \u201cAmerica first\u201d administration will certainly go a long way towards helping a mega-deal like the AVGO/QCOM merger go through.</p> \n <p>I have no plans to sell my AVGO. I think this is a long-term growth story and prior to this merger news, I suspected that AVGO would be one of the most impressive,dividend growth companies in the market, if not the most impressive, over the coming years. AVGO is highly profitable and has a habit of implementing very shareholder friendly maneuvers. This company increased its shareholder dividend by 100% last year and I was expecting another very significant increase this December as well. The attempted QCOM purchase has tempered my expectation in this regard. Surely, AVGO won\u2019t put undue pressure on its balance sheet with a large dividend increase alongside a $100b acquisition. In the short term, this is disappointing to me as a DGI investor; however, assuming the deal goes through, AVGO/QCOM will be a powerhouse in the semiconductor space and I look forward to owning an outsized position.</p> \n <p>I am however considering selling my QCOM stake. I\u2019ve seen several noted SA contributors chime in on this issue of late and now that QCOM\u2019s share price is approaching $70, it\u2019s my turn to throw my hat into the ring. Due primarily to issues in its highly profitable QTL segment, QCOM\u2019s earnings outlook is bleak moving forward. QCOM\u2019s bottom line has really suffered thus far in 2017 as the company attempts to resolve legal issues with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) as well as other foreign entities. Technology sales were up 7% on the year for QCOM; however, licensing sales were down 16% because of ongoing royalty disputes. Both QCOM and AAPL seem to have dug in their heels with regard to this issue and I don\u2019t see it going away anytime soon. QCOM has some of the world\u2019s best patent related lawyers and it has a successful history of defending its business model, but then again, AAPL is no slouch.</p> \n <p>I think it\u2019s speculative, at best, to pick a winner right now. I also think it\u2019s speculative to assume which company, QCOM or AAPL, needs the other one most to succeed moving forward. All of this speculation played a large role in driving down QCOM\u2019s share price to the low $50\u2019s where it was trading before AVGO came in with its $70 offer (the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty). Investors need to keep this in mind when throwing around takeover target prices in the $80, $90, and even $100 range. Without this AVGO deal, I suspect QCOM\u2019s share price would still be languishing in the royalty dispute gutter. That's especially given even more uncertainty still surrounding QCOM\u2019s NXPI acquisition, which is what many QCOM investors (including myself) have hung their future growth hats on for this company.</p> \n <p>Because of QCOM\u2019s bottom line issues, the company is trading at levels today that it hasn't seen since early 2013. If you believe that the bottom line woes relating to the royalty disputes are going to be short-lived, then this isn\u2019t exactly an apples to apples comparison. However, like I said above, I see no reason to believe that QCOM\u2019s QTL sales/earnings are going to shoot back up to previous levels in the short-term, at least. On a forward basis, QCOM is trading for nearly 20x its 2018 average analyst EPS expectation of $3.54, which is significantly lower than the $4.28 it posted in 2017 (it\u2019s worth noting that this $4.28 EPS figure is non-GAAP, QCOM\u2019s 2017 GAAP earnings were just $1.65). 20x is a steep price to pay for a company in this space; Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\">INTC</a>), which has been posting solid growth as of late, is trading for less than 14x its forward EPS estimates.</p> \n <p>I see little margin of safety left in my QCOM shares, and that is causing me to strongly consider selling (or at the very least, trimming my position) and locking in gains. What\u2019s more, the AVGO news has pushed QCOM out of the red and into the black for me. I was content holding (and adding to) my depressed QCOM stake due to its low valuation and its very high dividend yield is the $50\u2019s, but now that the company is trading for ~$70, I think that AVGO might be offering me a nice opportunity to transition out of a company that has been a dog for me at a profit.</p> \n <p>The biggest issue that I have with selling my QCOM shares in the income that I would lose. QCOM pays what I believe to be a relatively safe, high dividend yield. My yield on cost is 3.7% and even after the company\u2019s recent run-up, shares are still yielding a strong 3.3%. Although I suspect QCOM\u2019s dividend growth will slow in the near future because of the aforementioned QTL issues that are hurting profits, QCOM has been a very strong dividend growth play for income oriented investors in the recent past and it\u2019s difficult for me to part ways with shares when management has proven itself to be so generous to shareholders. With that said, QCOM\u2019s recent share price gains are equivalent to more than 8 years worth of dividend payments at the current annual rate and it\u2019s not as if I couldn\u2019t find another company with a similar yield/dividend growth prospects at a cheaper valuation in today\u2019s market.</p> \n <p>I haven\u2019t made a move yet with regard to my QCOM stake, but the more I think about it, I\u2019m leaning towards selling/trimming my stake in the near future.

We're also not convinced margins can be stretched in a meaningful way. The company does produce copious amounts of free cash flow and it does have promising longer-term growth opportunities. Analog Devices (ADI) really has something to be proud of, as explained by CEO Vincent Roche during the Q4CC: However, the evolution of GAAP earnings is considerably less exuberant during that period: So it has not all been a good news show. Despite the EPS stagnation, shareholders still have been amply rewarded: We'll first look at the growth opportunities of the company: Industrial market (46% of revenue) This sector grew by 20% and some analysts are worried this is not sustainable. Indeed, the average over the past 5 years is only 5% growth. Management argues that this is sustainable. Automotive (15%) The company has new radar technology which management claims has superior range and resolution \"beyond anything available in the market.\" This can set the company up for the coming ramp in autonomous driving. Another considerable growth opportunity lies in the company's A2B (Automotive Audio Bus) for in-car infotainment systems. Here is CEO Vincent Roche during the Q4CC: However, Q1 is a seasonally slow quarter here and revenues will decline sequentially in the mid single digits. However, later in the year things are set to improve as inventory issues (of battery management products from the LTC portfolio) in China are worked out of the system. Consumer (21%) While it had a good 2017 and especially good Q4, in 2018 it is still expected to go down \"meaningfully\" as a result of a weaker portable market. Most of that is due to losing sockets in Apple's (AAPL) new phones. Communications (18%) This sector had a good Q4 and the company has had a bumper ride with the 10-fold revenue increase for their software defined radio solutions in the past 4 years. Q4 was good in wireless but the wire line business is suffering from a familiar decline in China that is also plaguing many of the optical networking companies. The company is well placed to keep benefiting from the 4G, 4.5G and later the 5G wireless build-out, especially after acquiring LTC and its power management solutions. So for FY2018, it looks like growth still mainly has to come from the industrial sector, especially in the beginning of the year. The bulls are making much of the possibilities for industry consolidation and there is something to be said for this. Here is Mark Lipacis from Jefferies (from Barrons): Analog Devices itself is an important driver of this when it acquired linear Technology. Consolidation could increase pricing power and when asked on the Q4CC about this the CEO argued that (our emphasis): So it didn't hurt, then and management is going to focus on where prices are most defensible, as already noted by the Jefferies analyst. Here are the GAAP margins: Not much of a trend, so there doesn't seem to be all that much leverage, if any. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 42.6% though, so there is a substantial difference between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, see for instance the guidance for Q1 FY2018 (from the earnings PR): Non-GAAP operating margin is guided at 40%-42%, which is hardly a decline for a seasonally weak quarter but the 14th week in the quarter is at least partly responsible for that. We've looked at non-GAAP margins, and these do indeed show considerable leverage: A big reason why this isn't manifest in the GAAP operating margins is the acquisition of LTC. The company also enjoyed a whopping 41% free cash flow margin in Q4, producing $630M in free cash flow which allowed them to pay back $350M in debt and pay $167M in dividends ($0.45 per share, $1.80 for the year for a pretty nice yield of 2.02%). This is what the new CFO Prashanth Mahendra plans to do, from the Q4CC: Apart from the issuing in relation to the Linear Technology acquisition earlier this year the company doesn't have a history of major dilution, in fact they did purchase a considerable amount of shares back (they had a $1B program early last year). The company does generate lots of free cash flow $630M just in Q4 alone. The Q3 GAAP figures were negative due to a one time $750M tax payment with respect to the LTC acquisition, which produced the sharp decline in the graph: Here you see the company has $6.8B in net debt amounting to 2.6x EBITDA. Valuation multiples have trended upwards: These all look scarily high but these are GAAP measures and backwards looking. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.16 in FY2018 rising to $5.59 in FY2019. That is a fairly stretched earnings multiple, but one has to take on board that this is a company that generates really lots of free cash flow which (excluding the one time tax payment for the LTC acquisition amounts to 37% of revenue. That really is very substantial, their long-term target is 34%-42%. You are allowed to pay a considerable multiple for a company that is able to produce figures like that. The company uses a good part of these to pay a substantial dividend. It also has a history of beating earnings expectations, two other points in its favor. However, we do see some near-term problems in the consumer sector and it remains to be seen whether their big industrial sector can maintain its torrent pace of growth. We're also not convinced the whether the company will be able to expand margins even further, it depends how much one reads into that consolidation argument boosting pricing power. Longer-term the company should continue to do well with growth opportunities in automotive and communications looking promising.

Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 42.6% though, so there is a substantial difference between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, see for instance the guidance for Q1 FY2018 (from the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17008293-analog-devices-reports-fourth-quarter-fiscal-year-2017-results\">earnings PR</a>):</p> \n <p>Non-GAAP operating margin is guided at 40%-42%, which is hardly a decline for a seasonally weak quarter but the 14th week in the quarter is at least partly responsible for that.</p> \n <p>We've looked at non-GAAP margins, and these do indeed show considerable leverage:</p> \n <p>A big reason why this isn't manifest in the GAAP operating margins is the acquisition of LTC.</p> \n <p>The company also enjoyed a whopping 41% free cash flow margin in Q4, producing $630M in free cash flow which allowed them to pay back $350M in debt and pay $167M in dividends ($0.45 per share, $1.80 for the year for a pretty nice yield of 2.02%).</p> \n <p>This is what the new CFO Prashanth Mahendra plans to do, from the Q4CC:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Apart from the issuing in relation to the Linear Technology acquisition earlier this year the company doesn't have a history of major dilution, in fact they did purchase a considerable amount of shares back (they had a <a href=\"http://investor.analog.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=955131\">$1B program</a> early last year).</p> \n <p>The company does generate lots of free cash flow $630M just in Q4 alone. The Q3 GAAP figures were negative due to a one time $750M tax payment with respect to the LTC acquisition, which produced the sharp decline in the graph:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Here you see the company has $6.8B in net debt amounting to 2.6x EBITDA.</p> \n <p>Valuation multiples have trended upwards:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>These all look scarily high but these are GAAP measures and backwards looking. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.16 in FY2018 rising to $5.59 in FY2019.</p> \n <p>That is a fairly stretched earnings multiple, but one has to take on board that this is a company that generates really lots of free cash flow which (excluding the one time tax payment for the LTC acquisition amounts to 37% of revenue.</p> \n <p>That really is very substantial, their long-term target is 34%-42%. You are allowed to pay a considerable multiple for a company that is able to produce figures like that.</p> \n <p>The company uses a good part of these to pay a substantial dividend. It also has a history of beating earnings expectations, two other points in its favor.</p> \n <p>However, we do see some near-term problems in the consumer sector and it remains to be seen whether their big industrial sector can maintain its torrent pace of growth.</p> \n <p>We're also not convinced the whether the company will be able to expand margins even further, it depends how much one reads into that consolidation argument boosting pricing power.</p> \n <p>Longer-term the company should continue to do well with growth opportunities in automotive and communications looking promising.</p> \n <p>Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. </p> \n <p>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

We present a virtual portfolio containing the top 50 dividend growth stocks held in established dividend ETFs. Readers are invited to compare their own dividend growth portfolios with the top 50 holdings of dividend ETFs. The highest ranked stock is XOM, followed by PG and JNJ. The article explains the ranking method and provides key data of the 50 stocks, including fair value estimates from Morningstar. In December last year, I presented the Top Holdings of Dividend ETFs, a virtual portfolio of dividend growth stocks compiled from 27 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in dividend-paying stocks. In June 2017, I presented an update based on 28 dividend ETFs. To compile the virtual portfolio, I analyze the top 25 holdings in each ETF and assign scores proportional to the size of each holding. Summing the scores of individual holdings allows me to rank them by popularity, and so to find the top holdings of these dividend ETFs. This article repeats the exercise, this time with 32 dividend ETFs. I present the top 50 holdings along with key statistics and fair value estimates from Morningstar. ETFs are investment funds that hold assets like stocks, commodities, or bonds. Ownership of the assets under management is divided into ETF shares, which are traded on public stock exchanges much like shares of stocks. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of profits, such as earned interest or dividends received. Investing in ETFs provides several benefits, including instant diversificationand passive investment. However, you have no control over the makeup of the ETF or its turnover rate. The investment manager determines the ETF's makeup and trading frequency and charges a recurring annual fee, expressed as the ETF's expense ratio Dividend ETFs invest in stocks that regularly pay and increase dividends. To identify dividend ETFs for this analysis, I used ETFdb's screener. I selected ETF (under Structure) and Equity (under Asset Class), then limited the search to Dividend ETFs (under Investment Style) in North America (under Region). These filters isolated 63 ETFs out of ETFdb's universe of 2,083 ETFs. Additionally, I wanted to limit the analysis to ETFs that have positive 3-year returns. I used the 3-Year Performanceslider (under Performance) and set the minimum to 0%, so isolating 32 ETFs with positive 3-year returns. In the table below, these ETFs are sorted by assets under management (in millions of dollars). The data source is ETFdb and the data presented in the table were extracted on 23 November 2017. In June's analysis, I analyzed 28 ETFs. This time there are 32 ETFs, and the tickers of the four \"new\" ETFs are colored green: To do the analysis, I created a spreadsheet and entered the tickers of the top 25 holdings for each of the 32 dividend ETFs. Alongside the tickers, I also entered the size of each holding. To rank the top holdings, I used the relative size of each holding to score the corresponding ticker. This proportional scoring system favors larger investments over smaller investments within the same ETF. For November's update, I wanted to give larger ETFs more say when calculating aggregate scores. In my view, using weights proportional to assets under management would skew the result too much. Specifically, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) is 878 times larger than the First Trust RBA Quality Income ETF (QINC)! Instead, I used weights based on the following formula: In essence, weights are assigned proportional to the number of digits in the assets column, minus 1: With proportional scores assigned to each ticker per ETF and weights assigned to each ETF, I simply calculated a weighted sum to get an aggregate score for each ticker. There are 290 unique tickers in my analysis spreadsheet. The following chart presents the top 50 holdings ranked by aggregate score. The tickers are color-coded by GICS sector: International Business Machines (IBM) appeared in the top 25 holdings of no fewer than 20 dividend ETFs, the most of any stock! Here is a table of frequencies (of appearance) of the top 10 ranked stocks: Interestingly, Microsoft (MSFT) appeared in only 9 of the top 25's, yet it is ranked higher than IBM, which appeared in 20 of the top 25's. The reason is that the dividend ETFs have rather large MSFT holdings and relatively smaller IBM holdings. I'm sure MSFT's stock performance over the last six months is a contributing factor: MSFT has added nearly 20% since the beginning of June, while IBM has been essentially flat. Comparing the top holdings of November 2017 to those of June 2017, some interesting changes are evident. First, consider how the top 10 holdings changed. Four stocks moved into the top 10 list (those in green-colored cells), displacing the stocks in the red-colored cells: Chevron (CVX) moved up 8 places, MSFT moved up 10 places, IBM moved up 14 places, and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) moved up 4 places. As for the top 50 holdings, the following 9 stocks are new (they're on the November 2017 list but not on the June 2017 list): These stocks dropped off the top 50 list (they're on the June 2017 list but not on the November 2017 list): Following is the entire list of holdings along with key statistics, organized by GICS sectors. In each table, Rank is the stock's position when ranked by aggregate score, while Freq indicates the number of dividend ETFs containing Ticker in their top 25 holdings. Years are the number of consecutive years of dividend increases; Yield is the dividend yield as of the closing Price on 22 November 2017; and 3-DGR is the compound annual dividend growth rate over a 3-year period, where available. Finally, M*FVis Morningstar's Fair Value Estimate. Stocks trading below Morningstar's fair value estimate are highlighted in the price column. 1. Consumer Discretionary 2. Consumer Staples 3. Energy 4. Financials 5. Health Care 6. Industrials 7. Information Technology 8. Materials 9. Real Estate None 10. Telecommunication Services 11. Utilities There are no stocks in the Real Estatesector in the top 50 dividend ETF holdings, most probably because Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have their own category at ETFdb. Readers who manage their own dividend growth portfolios may find it interesting to compare their own portfolio to the top 50 holdings. Are there any surprises? How many of the top 10 stocks do you own? How about the top 25 stocks? Comparing my DivGro portfolio of 58 different stocks, I own 8 of the top 10, and 17 of the top 25 stocks: Perhaps more interesting are the stocks I own that are nowhere to be found in any of the top 25's of the dividend ETFs I analyzed: BXMT, HASI, and OHI are REITs (real estate investment trusts), which have their own category at ETFdb. There is a useful guide at ETFdb explaining the ins-and-outs of REIT ETFs. MAIN is organized as a business development company, which also has its own category at ETFdb. GILD and NVDA are relatively new dividend payers. As for RTN, SBUX, and SWK, I'm frankly surprised that none of these stocks make any of the top 25's. In my view, these are solid dividend growth stocks. In June 2017, I opened small positions in the so-called FANG stocks. Since these are not dividend paying stocks, I wouldn't expect them to appear in the top 25's of the dividend ETFs I analyzed. And, indeed, they don't. Analyzing the holdings of dividend ETFs is an insightful exercise. Publicly-available data on the top holdings and assets under management allows one to rank these holdings and to create a list of dividend growth stocks worthy of consideration. Please note that I'm not recommending any of the top holdings of dividend ETFs. Many of these stocks are trading above fair value and may not be suitable for investment at this time. Before investing in any of these stocks, please do a thorough analysis to determine if the stocks are worthy of your investment dollars. I included Morningstar fair value estimates to help with a superficial value assessment. Since publishing my first Top Holdingsarticle in December 2016, I've opened a position in the VanguardHigh Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) in March 2017. The main reason for investing in VYM was to increase my portfolio's overall diversification. I like the ETF's yield and low expense ratio, as well as its overall performance. So far, the ETF has returned 7.35% (or about 10.6% annualized). Other than VYM, I don't own any of the dividend ETFs covered in this article. I do own two closed-end funds in my portfolio, mainly to increase diversification and to boost DivGro's yield. These are the Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR) and the AllianzGI Equity and Convertible Income Fund (NIE). Investing in ETFs provides several benefits, including instant diversificationand passive investment. However, you have no control over the makeup of the ETF or its turnover rate. The investment manager determines the ETF's makeup and trading frequency and charges a recurring annual fee, expressed as the ETF's expense ratio. Dividend ETFs are good for beginning investors and especially for those with less than $10,000 to invest. You get a basket of stocks with a single trade, saving on commissions and reducing your risk. Also, there's no need to research or monitor 20-50 companies because the investment manager of the ETF does the job for you. Of course, there are drawbacks to owning dividend ETFs, including recurring annual fees and lack of control. Compounding fees could cost you a lot over a long investment period. Worse, though, you don't have any say in the makeup of the basket of stocks or the turnover rate. The investment manager may chase higher yields and so increase overall risk, or change out stocks and increase reinvestment risk. As a bonus, here is a summary of key data and ratings of the ETFs used in this analysis. Except where otherwise indicated, the data source is ETFdb. Thanks for reading!
